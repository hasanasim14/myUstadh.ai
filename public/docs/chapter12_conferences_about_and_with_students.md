## Chapter 12:  Conferences About and with Students

*Conferences with students as participants arise from and amplify assessment for learning practices. They provide the opportunity for students to understand their own learning needs and share their progress with others.* 

Conferences can be used to communicate in both assessment *for* and *of* learning contexts. All conferences involve sharing information; whether they are formative or summative in nature hinges on whether they occur during or after learning. Conferences are formative when the purpose is to give or receive feedback, to help students formulate goals, or to create with colleagues or parents an individualized program or other interventions for a student. Conferences are summative in nature when the purpose is to share the student's current status— information about learning that has already occurred—although these often lead to formulating a plan of action, so they also become formative. Summative *informs* , formative *takes action* .

To understand conference options, we can categorize them according to their purposes: offering feedback, setting goals, communicating progress, demonstrating competence, and planning an intervention. Figure 12.2 summarizes how topics, participants, and formats can be combined to create a variety of conference options to meet differing information and learning needs.

In this chapter we will describe each conference option and how to conduct it successfully to strengthen as well as report about learning.

### **Chapter 12 Learning Targets**

At the conclusion of Chapter 12 you will know how to do the following:

- Select conference options suited to your students' and their parents' needs.
- Organize conferences that don't require your participation.

■ Prepare for, conduct, and debrief each conference option.

**FIGURE 12.1** Keys to Quality Classroom Assessment

**Key 1: Clear Purpose** Who will use the information? How will they use it? What information, in what detail, is required?

**Key 2: Clear Targets** Are learning targets clear to teachers? What kinds of achievement are to be assessed? Are these learning targets the focus of instruction?

**Key 3: Sound Design**

Do assessment methods match learning targets? Does the sample represent learning appropriately? Are items, tasks, and scoring rubrics of high quality? Does the assessment control for bias?

**Key 4: Effective Communication**

Can assessment results be used to guide instruction? Do formative assessments function as effective feedback? Is achievement tracked by learning target and reported by standard?

Do grades communicate achievement accurately?

**Key 5: Student Involvement**

Do assessment practices meet students' information needs? Are learning targets clear to students? Will the assessment yield information that students can use to self-assess and set goals? Are students tracking and communicating their evolving learning?

### **THE FEEDBACK CONFERENCE**

In a *feedback* conference, students receive another's opinion about the strengths and weaknesses of their work. The purpose is to offer information that will provide them insight so they can continue to improve their work. A secondary purpose is to model the kind of thinking we want them to do when they self-assess. A feedback conference usually involves two people—student and responder. Although we most often think of teachers as the people giving the feedback, students who have had practice in discussing the quality of anonymous work can become quite good at offering useful insights into one another's work. For example, when students meet in writing groups, the purpose of the discussion is to offer formative feedback to each member. In any context, students can confer with a partner, or with a small group.

Feedback conferences are usually conducted at school, but students may also engage in a feedback conference with a parent at home. At school, these conferences can be scheduled so that all students are receiving or offering feedback at the same time, or students may be encouraged to schedule a conference with a partner whenever they need it or within a set time frame (as in the case of a project). Many teachers find it effective to allow students to choose whether they receive feedback from them or from a peer.

#### **Keys to Success**

First, remember the characteristics of effective feedback introduced in Chapter 2 (Chappuis, 2009):

- **1.** Direct attention to the intended learning. Point out strengths and offer specific information to guide improvement.
- **2.** Offer feedback during the learning.
- **3.** Offer it only if student work demonstrates at least partial understanding.
- **4.** Do not do all of the work for the student.
- **5.** Limit corrective information to the amount of advice the student can act on in the given time.

Prior to the feedback conference, make sure students understand the learning targets at the focus of the discussion (Assessment *for* Learning Strategy 1) and give students practice with assessing work representing the learning targets they are to master (Assessment *for* Learning Strategy 2). You might also ask students to think about the strengths and weaknesses of their work in preparation for attending a feedback conference, which can make it take less time. Figure 12.3 shows a form that students can use to record their prior thinking and also make note of the feedback they receive from you or a peer.

|                                   |                 |  |

**ADDRESSING THE TIME ISSUE.** Whether students are meeting in pairs, in groups, or with you, time will always be an issue. Obviously, it is a time saver for you whenever students offer useful feedback to each other. Your role then is to manage the time so everyone who needs or wants it has opportunity to receive feedback. Perhaps the most significant time problem arises in a student-teacher conference when the student needs extensive teaching in order to act on the feedback. The conference leaves the realm of feedback and enters the realm of private tutorial, which can cause it to take much more time than anticipated or practical. If you have limited time, make note of what feedback students don't understand or can't act on, rather than reteach extensively at each conference. Plan further large- or small-group instruction with those needs in mind. Another time saver is to schedule student-teacher conferences only with those who want or need one and allow other students to confer for feedback with each other.

**HELPING PARENTS UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF FEEDBACK.** Have you ever received a student's homework and noticed signs of parents crossing the line between helping and coauthoring? Parents can benefit from understanding the characteristics of effective feedback. Encourage them to use feedback to support learning without doing the work for their child. Let them know that when their child can't do what is expected, they can explain it if they want to, but doing the work for the child only masks the problem and leads to an inaccurate conclusion about her level of understanding, which further ensures that she won't be offered another chance to learn it.

 (For more about feedback and feedback conference options, see Chappuis, 2009, Chapter 3 .)

### **THE GOAL-SETTING CONFERENCE**

As we have seen throughout the book, students can set goals based on a single piece of work or on a collection of evidence. The purpose of a goal-setting conference generally is to guide them to the next steps in their learning within the framework of the content standards. The conference itself can be formal or informal; you can set aside a time when all students participate in a goal-setting conference; they can conduct one with a parent at home, at school with you or with a peer; it can be a part of an ongoing process that students engage in when they reach certain checkpoints in their learning; or it can be up to the student to select when it will occur. Students can set short-term or long-term goals. Goal setting is also often a part of other types of conferences—feedback, progress, and intervention conferences.

Not every student needs one-to-one guidance in setting specific and challen ging goals. Once they are clear about the intended learning and know where they are now in relation to that learning, you can model the process and explain what they are to do at each step. Many students will be able to proceed on their own from here. Others will benefit from individual guidance. Students may be able to confer with each other or with their parents, or they may need you to help them, especially with their action plan.

#### **Keys to Success**

Prior to the conference, students (or the teacher, if needed) should select one or more pieces of work that clearly indicate present status in relation to desired status. That requires that the learning targets students are working toward are clear to them and they understand what level of achievement their work shows. Students may be examining a single piece of work or selecting several samples from a working file or a growth portfolio, as described in Chapter 11 .

During the conference, the student and teacher (or other respondent) take the following steps:

- **1.** Clarify the learning target.
- **2.** Clarify current status.
- **3.** State the learning target as a goal.
- **4.** Make a plan.

 For Example 12.1 shows an elementary and a secondary version of a frame that students can use to record their goals during the conference.

**1. CLARIFY THE LEARNING TARGET.** Ask the student to explain the learning target —what he is working toward, not in terms of a grade, but in terms of the learning accomplished. What will he know or be able to do at the conclusion of this plan? If the student struggles to do this, offer help in the form of questions or prompts as needed.

**2. CLARIFY CURRENT STATUS.** With the student, review the pieces of evidence, not just a list of scores or grades. Reviewing only a list of grades can lead to fuzzy or too-general statements, such as "I will get better at math." Ask the student to be specific in identifying strengths and areas needing improvement. Example 12.1 shows the level of specificity required. Offer help in the form of questions or prompts as needed.

**3. STATE THE LEARNING TARGET AS A GOAL.** Often it isn't the whole learning target that a student needs to work on, but only a part of it. So at this step, ask the student to identify what exactly she needs to learn or practice. Again, Example 12.1 shows the level of detail required.

**4. MAKE A PLAN.** The plan answers the question, "How will I accomplish my goal?" It specifies the action the student will take, which may involve reviewing material learned previously, reworking a product or performance until it meets a certain level of quality, or learning something the student missed in the course of instruction. It may also include a notation about what help the student will need, the time frame for accomplishment of the goal, and reference to the evidence students will use to document attainment of their goal.

**For Example 12. Goal Frames**
**YOUNGER STUDENTS**

*Name:* Maria-Teresa Gonzales *Date:* October 7 

*I will learn:* multiplying when the numbers end in zero 

*My "before" picture—evidence I used to choose my goal:* **I got those ones wrong on the math check 10/6 

*My plan is to:* practice some at home tonight, Monday night, and Tuesday night**  *I need these materials:* practice problems 

*I will ask for help from:* Miss Barton explain it + check my work. Mom if I get stuck**  *I will be ready to show my learning on this day:* October 14 

*My "after" picture—I will show my learning by:* doing the problems right on the test 

**OLDER STUDENTS**

*Name: John Jurjevich Date: February 20* 

Learning Target: *Explain how the immune system works* 

Current level of achievement: *don't understand how a neutrophil works to fi ght infect ion* 

Evidence: *quiz on communicable diseases 2/19* 

What I need to learn: *to explain wh at a neutrophil does at three stages : chemot axis, phagocytosis, and apoptosis* 

Plan of action: *study the pages on pathogens and the immune system in the book and practice drawing the life cycle of a neutrophil, with all stages explained* 

Help needed—what and who: *book + me* 

Time frame: *before Feb. 26* 

Evidence of achieving my goal: *Tes t on Feb. 26* 

**Selecting a Plan of Action.** Even students who independently can identify what they need to work on sometimes need advice on how to go about getting better. For example, David may have reviewed his three previous lab reports and decided he needs to improve in writing hypotheses. He may have no idea how to do this, in which case his teacher can confer with him to explain what resources or opportunities are available.

Watch for students whose plan consists only of "Do my homework." Homework completion as a plan of action is tricky, because lots of learning problems *would* be solved if students would only do the practice work. All students *should* do their homework, and in all likelihood their achievement will improve when they attain this habit. However, a general action plan, "Do my homework," is not precise enough in most instances, and may not be the solution at all. Specific action beyond the regular work may be needed, and it may be accomplished in school or at home. When students create their action plans, they need to understand what role, if any, homework plays in attaining their specific goal.

**Identifying Assistance.** If every student needs assistance and they all need it from you, the teacher, this process will choke on its own rope. When Maria-Teresa (see For Example 12.1 ) knows what her goal is, but needs help learning the math procedure, she does need assistance. She may need it from you, or she may not. Could someone else in the room teach her the procedure for multiplying with zeroes? When you help students see their only resource is not always you, the line at your desk shortens and the process becomes more practical.

**Determining Time Frame.** Ask the student to set himself a time limit, or specify one. This helps him make a realistic plan and get motivated to start working. It also lets him decide or know when he will demonstrate his level of achievement of the goal.

**Collecting "Before" and "After" Evidence.** Goal setting is most satisfying when we see real progress toward the desired outcome. Part of the motivational hook for students and the key to re-engaging marginally interested students is tangible, hard evidence of progress. A system that lets students keep track of where they started and what they have accomplished increases accountability for follow through. Instituting a simple procedure for students to collect "before" and "after" evidence contributes to developing a sense that "I can set goals and carry them through to completion." If students do not have a folder or portfolio to keep track of their goals and evidence, you can set up a simple system, such as a "goals" folder or a manila envelope with the goal frame stapled to the outside and evidence such as the beginning point, progress toward the goal, and goal attainment tucked inside.

**Ensuring Student Ownership.** To make the process instructionally beneficial, let the student do as much of the talking and puzzling through the steps as possible. Remember, the student will need to understand three things: what the intended learning is, where she is now with respect to the intended learning, and what her options are for closing the gap. You can intervene as needed with questions or prompts, but try not to do the work for her. The person who sets the goals owns them, and if you own the goal, the student won't be doing much of the work.

### **THE PROGRESS CONFERENCE**

A progress conference can focus on growth over time or on level of achievement. It can be conducted during school, after school, or at home. Students, parents, and teachers can all take part or students may conduct them without teacher participation. Several of the portfolios described in Chapter 11 can serve as the basis for the progress conference: project, growth, or achievement. You can also use the "Before" and "After" evidence and other artifacts from goal-setting conferences as a point of discussion in a progress conference.

#### **Focusing on Growth over Time**

This is a simple, narrowly focused conference topic, generally conducted between two people. Struggling learners especially benefit from noticing that they have been successful in achieving a short-term goal in a short period of time. The conference can take place with a parent or other adult at home, with another student at school, or with you or another staff member at school. You can specify the audience or you can let students choose who they wish to share with. Either the project or the growth portfolio work well to ground the discussion with evidence.

#### **Focusing on Achievement Status**

This type of progress conference focuses on a student's current level of learning. This is generally the type of parent-teacher conference scheduled at the end of a grading period to elaborate on information from the report card. When the student is present, these conferences are referred to as "student-involved" or "student-led" conferences. Because of their effectiveness in creating and sustaining student motivation, we believe that progress conferences focusing on achievement should involve students.

This type of conference is not limited to the end of a grading period: it can happen any time you or your students want or need to share information about their learning status. Any of the portfolios described in Chapter 11 can be used during these conferences. However, the growth, project, and/or achievement portfolios are the ones most frequently used to substantiate the discussion. If students have evidence of goal setting and attainment, you may want to include that, too.

#### **Identifying Participants**

Conference participants can vary to suit the topics and information needs. The structure generally takes one of two forms: a *two-way conference* or a *three-way conference* . In a two-way conference, the student meets with another student, the teacher, a parent, or another significant adult. In a three-way conference, participants are the student, the teacher, and a parent or significant adult. For many students and parents, it is a novel idea to have the student present during a conversation about the student's learning. Some initial preparation is required to make two-way and three-way student-involved conferences run smoothly.

#### **Preparing the Students**

When the focus of the conference is to demonstrate growth over time, help students prepare by guiding their choice of artifacts to use as evidence of improvement. Portfolios and working folders come in handy here, as it can be quite powerful for students to assemble work samples showing a clear "before" and "after" picture of their learning. (Refer to Chapter 11 for more information on growth portfolios and working folders.) Students also should be prepared to explain the learning target or targets, talk briefly about what they did to improve, and summarize what they can do now that they couldn't do before.

Figure 12.4 shows a form that can be used both while preparing for and conducting a "Demonstration of Growth" conference.

When the focus of the conference is to provide an overview of the student's current achievement level, help students prepare by ensuring they have a clear understanding of the learning targets and work samples that show what they have learned. They must be able to discuss strengths, areas needing improvement or areas of challenge, and goals they have set for themselves. They will need time to rehearse the conference with others in the classroom.

#### **Preparing the Parents or Other Adults**

When the conference will involve parents or other significant adults, we recommend that you set a conference agenda together with students. Students, if they are able to,

can write the invitation to parents and/or other participants informing them of what to expect and what their role will be. Some teachers send work samples that will be the focus of the discussion home in advance for parents to think about in preparation for the conference.

When the format is a three-way conference, especially when it replaces the traditional parent-teacher conference, as a part of your explanation to parents, we recommend that you offer them the option of scheduling an additional meeting, without the student present, to discuss any concerns that they may not want to raise in the threeway setting.

#### **Conducting a Two-Way Conference**

You can schedule several two-way (student and parents) conferences at the same time throughout the day. Your role is to be available to clarify information as needed. Before the conference begins, each student introduces their parents to you. Then they all go to the conference area (for example, students' desks or tables set up for that purpose). Students begin by sharing the conference agenda with their parents. They then explain the learning targets and show samples of their work illustrating growth over time, level of achievement, or evidence of having met goals—whatever the topic of the conference is. Parents listen carefully, ask clarifying questions, and offer comments about students' work and learning. Students may have already set goals and created action plans for future work, which they can discuss at this time, or students and parents may do that together as a part of the conference.

#### **Conducting a Three-Way Conference**

The three-way conference is similar to the two-way conference, in that students introduce their parents to you and begin the conference by sharing the agenda. It differs in that, because you are a participant, you schedule only one at a time. Students explain the learning targets and proceed as described previously. The parents' role is also much the same. Your role as teacher is to help students clarify their comments, if needed, and to add to their descriptions of strengths and areas needing improvement, again if needed. We recommend that you end each conference with a summary of the student's strengths and positive contributions to the class.

#### **Followup**

It is important to find out how the experience went for all involved. Debriefing the conference can be as simple as asking students to complete a conference evaluation form, such as the one shown in Figure 12.5 , reading the comments from participants, and discussing responses with the class as a whole.

You will also want to offer parents and other participants in the conference an opportunity to share their feedback on the experience. Have evaluation forms such as the

| Name:                                    | Date: |
|------------------------------------------|-------|
| What I learned from this conference      |       |
| What I liked about it                    |       |
| What I would change about the conference |       |
|                                          |       |
| Other comments                           |       |

one shown in Figure 12.5 available for them to complete. In rare instances, you may have to address a less-than-positive outcome for a student or a parent, in which case, you may want to schedule a followup conference.

### **THE SHOWCASE CONFERENCE**

In this conference, the purpose is to demonstrate mastery of or competence on predetermined learning targets. Sometimes is it also used to share the celebration portfolio, as described in Chapter 11 . Participants can include the student and one or more of the following: another student, parent, teacher, other significant adult, or another staff member at the school. Generally, these conferences take place at school. In a formal showcase conference focused on competence or mastery, the student meets with a group of any number of adults, from parents and significant adults to community members.

#### **Preparing the Students**

When the purpose is to demonstrate mastery or competence, help students prepare by ensuring they have a clear understanding of the learning targets and work samples that support the assertion of mastery or competence. Then guide them in preparing explanations of how their evidence supports their claim. The explanation should refer directly to the standards of quality you are using to define mastery or competence. They will need time to rehearse presenting their evidence and explanation with other students.

#### **Conducting a Showcase Conference**

The student's role in a showcase conference is to share the agenda with the participants, explain the learning targets that are the focus of the achievement, and present and discuss how the work samples presented illustrate competence on specified learning targets. The student also answers participants' questions. The participants in a showcase conference listen carefully, ask questions, and make comments about the work. Your role is to be prepared to facilitate, encourage, and clarify as needed.

#### **Followup**

As with previous conference formats, conducting followup is key to their success. We recommend that all participants, including students, complete a conference evaluation form (see Figure 12.5 ) so that you can obtain information about what worked well and what didn't (if anything), identify any problems you need to deal with, and gather ideas for what you might do next time. Summarize and share comments with students, parents, and any other participants. Also, give students the opportunity to debrief the experience as a group.

### **THE INTERVENTION CONFERENCE**

Planning an intervention with others can occur any time a student is having difficulty. As a teacher, you meet with parents to discuss a problem with behavior, work habits, or achievement and make a plan for improvement. You meet with other teachers and specialists when a student's work is significantly above or below expectations to modify instruction or to recommend placement in a specialized program. Generally, the student is not present in these conferences, although in some cases, especially the parent-teacher discussion of a problem, the student's perspective and participation can help you craft a solution.

Central to the effectiveness of these conferences is the quality of records you keep. This context requires separate records for level of achievement, work habits, effort, attendance, and the like, as well as records that allow you to determine the student's strengths and weaknesses relative to the learning targets to be mastered. With such records, you are able to pinpoint problems and participate in recommending suitable solutions. Without them, you may lack credible data from which to draw conclusions about the best course of action.

### **Summary**

In the majority of instances, conferences about students can include students to the benefit of all involved. They can participate in and even lead them, but only with the proper preparation throughout the year. To comment accurately and in detail about their work, students must have been involved all along in their learning and in assessment; they must be prepared to discuss what the intended learning is, where they are now with respect to it, and what they might do next to continue as learners.

In this chapter, we have looked at conferences that function in assessment *for* and *of* learning contexts: conferences whose purposes are to offer feedback, to set goals, to share improvement, to communicate about achievement, and to plan an intervention. We have suggested who to include in each type of conference, what preparation will maximize success for all

involved, and what followup is needed. In addition, we have explained what happens in a two-way and three-way progress conference, and a showcase conference.

We encourage you to select carefully from the conference options available to meet your needs and the information needs of parents, but most especially to think about how students can be involved in conferences to take responsibility for their learning and to show what they have accomplished.

### **CHAPTER 12ACTIVITIES**

End-of-chapter activities are intended to help you master the chapter's learning targets. They are designed to deepen your understanding of the chapter content, provide discussion topics for learning team meetings, and guide implementation of the practices taught in the chapter.

Forms for completing each activity appear in editable Microsoft Word format in the Chapter 12 CD file. Documents on the CD are marked with this symbol:

#### **Chapter 12 Learning Targets**

At the conclusion of Chapter 12 you will know how to do the following:

- **1.** Select conference options suited to your students' and their parents' needs.
- **2.** Prepare for, conduct, and debrief each conference option.
    - **3.** Organize conferences that don't require your participation.

##### **  Activity 12.2 Conduct and Debrief a Feedback Conference**

After reading the section, "The Feedback Conference," work independently, with a partner, or with your team to complete this activity.

- **1.** Select a learning target for which you have a descriptive rubric. (Refer to the Chapter 7section, "Selecting, Revising, or Developing Rubrics" for more information on a suitable rubric.)
- **2.** Narrow the focus of your feedback to a manageable number of criteria, should students' work need revision.
- **3.** Make sure that students have had experience with the rubric and some version of Assessment *for* Learning Strategies 1 and 2. (Refer to the Chapter 7section, "Seven Strategies for Using Rubrics as Instructional Tools in the Classroom" for more information on how to do this.)
- **4.** Select two to three students whose work shows at least partial understanding or mastery to conference with. Copy a form such as the Feedback Conference Form in Figure 12.3or the "Stars and Stairs" form for each student.
- **5.** Prior to the feedback conference, ask the students to focus on one criterion and find rubric phrases that describe what they believe their strengths and areas needing improvement are. Have them write their thoughts on the form you have chosen.
- **6.** Meet with students one at a time. Let them share their self-assessment first. Then share your feedback. If appropriate, point out a strength the student overlooked and add to or modify what the student said they need to work on. Let the student be the writer on the Feedback Conference Form. The student then completes the "My Plan" portion of the form taking into account their own thoughts and the feedback you have given. They can do this either under your guidance or on their own at your discretion. Many teachers find that when students think about their work first, these conferences can be successfully completed in three minutes or less.
- **7.** Using the Conference Evaluation Form shown in Figure 12.5as a guide, debrief the feedback conference a day or two later with each student.
- **8.** If you are working with a partner or a team, share your experience with the feedback conference, using the Conference Evaluation Form in Figure 12.5as a guide.

##### **Activity 12.5 Reflect on Your Own Learning**

Review the Chapter 12learning targets and select one or more that represented new learning for you or struck you as most significant from this chapter. If you are working individually, write a short reflection that captures your current understanding. If you are working with a partner or a team, either discuss what you have written or use this as a discussion prompt for a team meeting.

Reflect on Chapter 12 Learning

##### ** Activity 12.6 Select Portfolio Artifacts**

Any of the activities from this chapter can be used as portfolio entries. Select any activity you have completed or artifacts you have created that will illustrate your competence at the Chapter 12learning targets:

- **1.** Select conference options suited to your students' and their parents' needs.
- **2.** Prepare for, conduct, and debrief each conference option.
- **3.** Organize conferences that don't require your participation.

If you are keeping a reflective journal, you may want to include Chapter 12 's entry in your portfolio.

##### ** Activity 12.7 Stage a Share Fair**

Your learning team can plan a "share fair" to let others know what you have been doing in your classrooms and team meetings throughout the study of this book. The success of this activity depends on having kept a classroom assessment portfolio and having completed Activity 11.5, "Review Your Own Classroom Assessment Portfolio." Your audience can be other learning teams or colleagues who are not participating in this study. Both options are explained here.

**Option 1: Sharing with Other Learning Teams**

- **1.** Meet with your own team to plan what you will share. Each learning team member brings their portfolio to the meeting and spends a few minutes explaining its artifacts and what they illustrate.
- **2.** Your learning team selects from all team members' portfolios the artifacts to be shared with others and prepares a display that includes the key idea or ideas illustrated by each artifact, any brief explanatory information needed, the artifact itself, a reflection from Activity 11.5, and the name(s) and contact information of person(s) submitting the artifact. Often teams spend one meeting sharing and selecting artifacts and another preparing them for display.
- **3.** Find a good place to stage your "Share Fair." Have each team set up around the room.
- **4.** Assign one person to stay with the team's display to give a short explanation and/ or to answer questions. The rest of the team circulates to other displays. You can rotate the responsibility of staying with the display so all have a chance to see what others have done.

**Option 2: Sharing with Colleagues Who Are Not Part of a Learning Team**

- **1.** Meet with your team to plan what you will share. Each team member brings their portfolio to the meeting and spends a few minutes explaining its artifacts and what they illustrate.
- **2.** Each of you then selects your own artifacts to share with others. Together, your team decides the method of sharing. Here are two options:
    - In a large group setting, such as a faculty meeting, you each can give a short description of the key idea your artifact illustrates and a brief explanation of how you used it and what you noticed happening with students as a result. You can involve the audience in a brief activity that simulates a part of what you had your students do, if appropriate.
    - You can follow the same procedure in a smaller group format, such a department meeting.
- You can each create a display similar to the one described in Option 1, and set the displays up in a room such as the cafeteria or library. You can each give a short explanation to small groups as they rotate through your team members' displays.
- **3.** In each of the sharing options, be sure to include a description of the key idea or ideas illustrated and a reflection on its impact on students and learning.

## Chapter 11: Portfolios
From Chapter 11 of *Strategies Classroom Assessment for Student Learning: Doing It Right – Using It Well*, Second Edition. Jan Chappuis, Rick Stiggins, Steve Chappuis, Judith Arter. Copyright © 2012 by Pearson Education. All rights reserved.

*We need a more robust display of evidence than a collection of grades can provide to tell the full story of student achievement and of their journey toward competence. More importantly, so do students.* 

Portfolios have at their heart the desire to capture and communicate depth of student learning. A *portfolio* is a collection of artifacts put together to tell a story. We often associate portfolios with artists, who use them to communicate visually about their talent, style, and range of work; or with writers, who put them together to illustrate their writing capabilities. The contents are selected to offer a rich and detailed view of their subject's characteristics or qualities.

Beyond their potential as a rich source of information, in the classroom portfolios can play a significant role in learning. Many times the responsibility for collecting, interpreting, and sharing portfolio contents falls to the teacher. However, we overlook a powerful learning opportunity when the *subject* of the portfolio—the student—is not also the *creator* . Collecting, organizing, and reflecting on their own work builds students' understanding of themselves as learners and nurtures a sense of accomplishment. Becoming reflective learners, developing an internal feedback loop, learning to set goals, and noticing new competencies and new challenges are all habits of thought we can cultivate in students through the use of portfolios.

Portfolios can tell lots of different stories. The keys to effective and efficient portfolio use lie in knowing which story you want to tell, maximizing the students' role, and managing the variables accordingly. In this chapter we will explore the kinds of portfolios commonly used today and purposes for each, student and teacher roles in preparing portfolios, sharing options, and keys to their successful use.

Chapter 11 addresses the shaded portions of Figure 11.1 . Figure 11.2 summarizes the portfolio decisions we will address.
