## Subject A Scoring Guide (University of California)

In holistic reading, raters assign each essay to a scoring category according to its dominant characteristics. The categories below describe the characteristics typical of papers at six different levels of competence. All the descriptions take into account that the papers they categorize represent two hours of reading and writing, not a more extended period of drafting and revision.

Score 6: A 6 paper commands attention because of its insightful development and mature style. It presents a cogent analysis of or response to the text, elaborating that response with well-chosen examples and persuasive reasoning. The 6 paper shows that its writer can usually choose words aptly, use sophisticated sentences effectively, and observe the conventions of written English.

Score 5: A 5 paper is clearly competent. It presents a thoughtful analysis of or response to the text, elaborating that response with appropriate examples and sensible reasoning. A 5 paper typically has a less fluent and complex style than a 6, but does show that its writer can usually choose words accurately, vary sentences effectively, and observe the conventions of written English.

Score 4: A 4 paper is satisfactory, sometimes marginally so. It presents an adequate analysis of or response to the text, elaborating that response with sufficient examples and acceptable reasoning. Just as these examples and this reasoning, will ordinarily be less developed than those in 5 papers, so will the 4 paper's style be less effective. Nevertheless, a 4 paper shows that its writer can usually choose words of sufficient precision, control sentences of reasonable variety, and observe the conventions of written English.

Score 3: A 3 paper is unsatisfactory in one or more of the following ways. It may analyze or respond to the text illogically; it may lack coherent structure or elaboration with examples; it may reflect an incomplete understanding of the text or the topic. Its prose is usually characterized by at least one of the following: frequently imprecise word choice; little sentence variety; occasional major errors in grammar and usage, or frequent minor errors.

Score 2: A 2 paper shows serious weaknesses, ordinarily of several kinds. It frequently presents a simplistic, inappropriate, or incoherent analysis of or response to the text, one that may suggest some significant misunderstanding of the text or the topic. Its prose is usually characterized by at least one of the following: simplistic or inaccurate word choice; monotonous or fragmented sentence structure; many repeated errors in grammar and usage.

Score 1: A 1 paper suggests severe difficulties in reading and writing conventional English. It may disregard the topic's demands, or it may lack any appropriate pattern of structure or development. It may be inappropriately brief. It often has a pervasive pattern of errors in word choice, sentence structure, grammar, and usage.

This table presents the Scoring Guide for Writing used by California State University, Fresno, which is designed to assess student writing across three critical dimensions: Knowledge of Conventions, Clarity and Coherence, and Rhetorical Choices. Each dimension is evaluated on a four-level scale: Beginning (1), Developing (2), Competent (3), and Accomplished (4). At the highest level (Accomplished), writing is nearly error-free, models the expected style and format, and demonstrates exceptional clarity and organization, making it pleasurable to read and potentially usable as an example for others. A Competent level indicates clear communication with minor errors, good organizational structure, and effective use of rhetorical strategies that align with the assignment’s goals. In contrast, writing at the Developing level may contain frequent mechanical and structural errors, inconsistencies in formatting, and unclear source documentation, which can distract or confuse the reader. The lowest level, Beginning, reflects writing that is marred by numerous errors, poor organization, and a lack of alignment with assignment requirements, resulting in a failure to communicate the intended message effectively.This rubric helps instructors evaluate student writing in a structured and objective manner, while also providing clear feedback for students to improve their writing skills.

This Science Assessment Rubric provides a structured framework for evaluating student understanding of science across four key domains: Science and Society, Basic Concepts and Fundamental Principles, Scientific Approach, and Nature of Science. Scored on a 4-point scale (1 = Beginning to 4 = Accomplished), the rubric assesses a student’s ability to connect scientific knowledge with societal contexts, grasp core scientific principles, apply scientific thinking, and reflect on the nature of science. It supports consistent, holistic assessment of scientific literacy and critical reasoning.

This table is a Science Assessment Rubric from California State University, Fresno, designed to evaluate students' integrative understanding of science within the context of general education. It assesses student performance across four key dimensions: Science and Society, Basic Concepts and Fundamental Principles, Scientific Approach, and Nature of Science. Each category is rated on a four-point scale: Beginning (1), Developing (2), Competent (3), and Accomplished (4). The rubric measures how well students can relate science to societal issues, understand and apply core scientific concepts, utilize scientific methodology, and demonstrate awareness of how science functions within broader human knowledge systems. At the highest level (Accomplished), students are expected to defend informed positions, apply principles across disciplines, and show scientific reasoning. Lower levels reflect less developed skills, ranging from basic recognition of scientific vocabulary to a lack of understanding of science’s role and principles. This rubric is intended to guide both instruction and assessment by clarifying expectations for scientific literacy in a general education context.

This Writing Assessment Rubric outlines a comprehensive framework for evaluating student writing across five core quality criteria: Thesis/Focus (Originality and Clarity), Organization, Support/Reasoning (Ideas and Details), and Use of Sources/Documentation. Each criterion is assessed across four proficiency levels—from No/Limited Proficiency to High Proficiency—providing detailed descriptors that reflect a progression from underdeveloped to sophisticated writing. The rubric is designed to guide both instruction and evaluation by emphasizing clarity of purpose, logical structure, depth of reasoning, and ethical integration of sources

http://www.neiu.edu/~neassess/gened.htm#rubric
This table is a writing assessment rubric used to evaluate the quality of a student’s written work across several important criteria. It assesses five main areas: originality and clarity of the thesis or focus, organization of ideas, quality of support and reasoning (including both ideas and details), and the use and documentation of sources. For each of these areas, the rubric outlines four levels of proficiency—No/Limited Proficiency, Some Proficiency, Proficiency, and High Proficiency—each with specific descriptions to guide evaluation. These levels help determine how effectively a student presents a clear and original thesis, organizes their content, supports their arguments with logical and relevant reasoning, and uses sources to enhance their writing without relying too heavily on quotations. The rubric is intended to promote consistent, objective grading and to help students understand the expectations for high-quality academic writing.

The Holistic Critical Thinking Scoring Rubric provides a structured framework for assessing the depth and quality of critical thinking. It defines four performance levels—4 (highest) to 1 (lowest)—based on students’ ability to interpret information accurately, evaluate arguments, consider alternative perspectives, draw logical conclusions, and justify reasoning. High scorers demonstrate nuanced analysis, fair-mindedness, and strong justification of conclusions, while lower scorers show bias, weak reasoning, and resistance to evidence. This rubric supports comprehensive evaluation of critical thinking in written, verbal, or interdisciplinary tasks

Extensiveness: The writer's knowledge of the subject lacks range or quality.
Perspective: The information presented reveals the writer's failure to assimilate or to understand the material. The writer's assertions lack awareness of alternative points of view AND of
implications beyond the immediate subject.

#### **Objective B.**
 Students' writing will demonstrate awareness of the reader. This criterion concerns the writer's awareness of a known, assumed, or likely reading audience. In demonstrating this awareness, the writer must accommodate the reader's attitudes toward or familiarity with the subject, as well as the reader's comprehension level. The writer's development, diction, and emphasis will reflect the degree to which the writer has identified and is addressing those readers.** 
 **4 OUTSTANDING**
- Development: The writer's explanations and uses of evidence, illustrations, or other definitive details are highly appropriate for the reader.
- Diction: The writer's word choices clearly demonstrate an awareness of the reader. The language seems deliberately chosen to aid the reader's understanding of the subject (including definitions where appropriate).
- Emphasis: The writer's discussion or argumentation is consistently clear and appropriate to the reader and to the purpose. In emphasizing important points, the writer uses evidence logically and carefully.
 **3 EFFECTIVE**
- Development: The writer's explanations and uses of evidence, illustrations, or other definitive details are generally appropriate for the reader
- Diction: The writer's word choices demonstrate an awareness of the reader. The language is consistent and seems generally appropriate to the reader's understanding of the subject (including definitions where appropriate).

- Diction: The writer's word choices indicate an awareness of the reader, but the identity of the reader is either unclear or inappropriate in some respects. Although the vocabulary seems fairly consistent, the language seems chosen more for the writer's convenience than for the reader's understanding.
- Emphasis: The writer's discussion or argumentation is generally clear or appropriate to the reader and to the purpose, but may be lacking in some aspect of the use of logic or evidence.
 **1 INEFFECTIVE**
- Development: The writer generally lacks an awareness of the reader, for the discussion lacks evidence, illustrations, or other definitive details.
- Diction: The writer's word choices fail to reflect an awareness of the reader because either the vocabulary or the reference to the reader is inconsistent or inappropriate.
- Emphasis: The writer's discussion or argumentation is generally unclear or inappropriate to the reader and to the purpose. The writing lacks emphasis, or is seriously defective in the use of logic or evidence.

#### **Objective C.**

   **1 INEFFECTIVE**
The writer's misuses or omissions of punctuation frequently interfere with meaning.

#### **Objective F.**
 Students' writing will demonstrate the use of sentence structure to establish and clarify meaning. This criterion describes the writer's control of the elements of sentence construction to establish, clarify, and reinforce the meaning of the sentences. Concerns here include the writer's use not only of appropriate conventions of grammar and usage (e.g., subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement, verb forms, etc.) but also of sentence patterns to establish relationships among ideas (e.g., coordination, subordination, parallelism).**
 **4 OUTSTANDING**
Syntax: The writer's use of clauses to establish sentence patterns consistently reinforces or emphasizes relationships among ideas.
Clarity: All parts of the sentence agree clearly and logically. The writer demonstrates a consistently good grasp of appropriate usage, grammar, and idiom. The sentences contain no misplaced words or phrases. The word order also seems deliberately and appropriately chosen for emphasis or for reinforcing the intended meaning.
Completeness: All sentences are grammatically complete.
 **3 EFFECTIVE**
Syntax: For the most part, the writer's use of clauses to establish sentence pattern generally reinforces or emphasizes relationships among ideas.

Completeness: All sentences are grammatically complete.
 **2 ADEQUATE**
- Syntax: The writer's use of clauses to establish sentence patterns reflects relationships among idea, but connections might sometimes be inappropriate or weak.
- Clarity: Grammar or usage errors may appear, but they do not seriously confuse the intended meaning. An occasional sentence contains a misplaced word or phrase, which confuses the meaning.
Completeness: Except for an isolated error, all sentences are grammatically complete.
 **1 INEFFECTIVE**
Syntax: Few, if any, sentence patterns reflect appropriate relationships among ideas.
Clarity: Grammar or usage errors frequently confuse the intended meaning. More than an
occasional sentence contain misplaced words or phrases which confuse the meaning.

This scoring guide provides a framework for assessing students' critical thinking abilities across three major skill areas: Interpretation, Analysis & Evaluation, and Presentation. It uses four levels of performance—Beginning, Developing, Competent, and Accomplished—to describe how effectively a student interprets information, evaluates arguments, and presents their ideas. The guide is designed to promote intellectual honesty, coherence, and depth in student work.

### Rubrics for Assessing Information Competence in the California State University
![](_page_57_Picture_1.jpeg),This rubric evaluates students’ information literacy across five core competencies, based on the ACRL (Association of College & Research Libraries) standards. These competencies include the ability to determine the extent of information needed, access it effectively, evaluate sources critically, use information for a specific purpose, and understand legal, ethical, and societal issues in using information. The rubric classifies performance into three levels: Beginner, Proficient, and Advanced, to help educators assess students' research skills and responsible information usage.
\*Prepared by the CSU Information Competence Initiative, October 2002, based on the 2000 ACRL *Information Literacy Competency Standards For Higher Education.* For more information, see http://www.calstate.edu/LS/1\_rubric.doc.

### **A Rubric for Rubrics:** *A Tool for Assessing the Quality and Use of Rubrics in Education*
Downloaded July 9, 2005 from http://its.monmouth.edu/facultyresourcecenter/Rubrics/A%20Rubric%20for%20Rubrics.htm 
![](_page_58_Picture_1.jpeg),This meta-rubric, developed by Dr. Bonnie B. Mullinix, is a tool for evaluating the effectiveness and implementation of rubrics in educational settings. It includes seven criteria: clarity of criteria, distinction between levels, reliability of scoring, clarity of expectations, support for metacognition, and learner engagement in rubric development. Each criterion is rated on a four-level scale from Unacceptable to Exemplary, helping instructors reflect on how rubrics guide learning, scoring consistency, and student involvement.
