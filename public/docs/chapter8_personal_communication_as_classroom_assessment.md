## Chapter 8: Personal Communication as Classroom Assessment
*"What's in a question, you ask? Everything. It is a way of evoking stimulating response or stultifying inquiry. It is, in essence, the very core of teaching."* 

—John Dewey (1933)

Who remembers what a noun is?" "How would you describe the workings of a food web to someone who had never heard of one?" "What patterns do you notice in this sequence of numbers?" "What do you think of when you hear the word *power* ? What do you think of when you hear the word *authority* ? Are *power* and *authority* the same?" While we may not have considered the questions we ask in the course of a day as a form of assessment, they are. Asking instructional questions is both a teaching and an assessment strategy; through careful questioning, we can access prior knowledge, pique curiosity, check for understanding, provoke and explore thinking, and create new learning.

Asking instructional questions is one personal communication assessment option. Others include class discussions, conferences and interviews, oral examinations, and student journals and logs. As with all assessment methods, personal communication can be used formatively or summatively. However, some options are better suited to each use than others. When personal communication is used formatively as assessment *for* learning, it can serve teachers' needs to gauge students' knowledge and understanding in order to diagnose problems and misconceptions and adjust instruction accordingly, one part of the formative picture. An equally important part is its ability to affect student learning directly. Done well, it can hook students' interest, deepen their conceptual understanding, and strengthen their reasoning proficiencies. And with careful attention to rules of accuracy,

some personal communication assessment options can serve to make summative decisions about students' level of achievement.

In this chapter we examine accurate and effective use of each of the personal communication options, how to avoid possible sources of bias that can distort results, and how to use personal communication in assessment *for* learning contexts.

#### **Chapter 8 Learning Targets**

At the end of Chapter 8 , you will know how to do the following:

- Frame questions to be used diagnostically to inform instruction
- Use questioning strategies to deepen students' understanding and reasoning proficiencies
- Structure class discussions for formative and summative use
- Conduct conferences, interviews, and oral examinations to obtain accurate information about student achievement
- Use student journals and logs as assessment *for* learning tools

This chapter does not entirely follow the same footprint as the three previous chapters on assessment methods. We begin in a similar fashion, examining when to use personal communication as an assessment method, but then discuss two general issues: sampling and wait time. For the remainder of the chapter, we address each personal communication option in turn, focusing on development considerations and offering suggestions for optimum use.

### **WHEN TO USE PERSONAL COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENT**

The first consideration for using personal communication as an assessment method is the type of learning target to be assessed, as described in the target–method match section of Chapter 4 . Personal communication options can assess knowledge, reasoning, and those skill targets requiring oral communication, such as speaking a foreign language and participating in group discussions.

| Journals and Logs                     | Students write to explain, explore, and deepen their own understanding; teacher and/or other students respond.| Formative   | K | R |    |

gives a brief summary of which option is best suited to each of the target types. We will elaborate further on the matches as we discuss each option.

Two additional conditions influence the effectiveness of personal communication as an assessment method:

- The teacher and the student must share a common language. This means a shared vocabulary and grammar as well as a common sense of the manner in which a culture shares meaning through verbal and nonverbal cues. Quiet or reserved students may not perform well in this kind of assessment context, regardless of their real achievement. To make this method work, teacher and student must connect in an open, communicative manner. This is more difficult for some students than for others. If the purpose is to gather summative evidence and personal communication is not required, you may want to plan for other options as well to ensure accuracy of results.
- Use personal communication assessment only when it is certain to generate enough information to make an adequate inference about student performance. This is a sampling issue and it affects the accuracy of both formative and summative decisions.

#### **Sampling**

 In the context of personal communication, sampling has two dimensions: (1) gathering enough information for the target in question to meet the intended purpose; and (2) hearing from enough students to meet the intended purpose.

**GATHERING ENOUGH INFORMATION—SAMPLING THE LEARNING.** Once again with this method as with the others, the challenge is to gather enough information to lead us to a confident conclusion about student achievement without wasting time gathering too much. The sufficiency of a sample will be a function of the context within which we assess. For instance, if the target is narrow and sharply focused, as it often is during instruction, student responses to a very few questions will let us know if instruction is working for the class. Sometimes just one strategic question can tell us if a particular student is getting it and what to do if they are not. So the broader and more encompassing the learning target, the more questions we may need to pose to cover the territory, so to speak.

In this same sense, how much is enough will be a function of the decision to be made on the basis of results. The scenario implied in the previous paragraph frames a relatively low-stakes decision. We gather a bit of data, act on it, and continue to assessment to see if we made a right decision—instructional interaction. But what if the impending decision carries more profound implications, such as when we intend to grade students in part based on the quality of their contributions to a class discussion. In this case, we would want (need) to gather more instances of contribution for each to lead us to a confident conclusion. So the purpose of the assessment should influence sample size.

There are no hard and fast rules for how many questions to ask when assessing via personal communication. This is very much a part of the art of classroom assessment: the broader the target and more grave the decision, the larger must be the sample of evidence.

**HEARING FROM ENOUGH STUDENTS—SAMPLING THE POPULATION.** Personal communication options that involve the whole class or a group of students run the risk of oversampling the knowledge and understanding of some students and undersampling the knowledge and understanding of others. This sampling issue arises only with personal communication—with selected response, written response, and performance assessments, all students are participating in the assessment. With personal communication options such as instructional questions and class discussions, it is likely that not all students will be responding to an equal degree. The challenge here is to maximize engagement. How we do that depends on our intent for use of the process and the information.

For example, when we want to determine if students have understood a concept just taught, we might ask a few oral questions. If we only call on students who raise their hands, we will not likely obtain a representative sample from which to make an accurate generalization about the whole class's level of understanding.

Here are some suggestions that maximize the instructional value of questions by maximizing engagement, and that also maximize the accuracy of the information by maximizing the sample size:

- In a group setting, don't call on a student to answer before asking the question. Asking the question first and then inviting responses increases the chances that all students will stay engaged.
- In a group setting, call on both volunteers and nonvolunteers. There are a number of simple systems for doing this. Many teachers put students' names on Popsicle® sticks or tongue depressors, keep them in a cup, and draw out a name at random after asking the question.
- Ask students to discuss their thinking in pairs or small groups. Designate a reporter to speak on behalf of the group, ask the group to designate a reporter, or call on one person in the group randomly. You can also number the groups and draw a number at random.
- Ask all students to write a response, then collect and read them aloud. Ask students to listen for similarities and differences. Use the responses as a springboard for their further questions and discussion. You may also be able to use common misconceptions and incorrect answers as the distracters for a multiple-choice item you create to measure this learning target on a summative assessment.
- Give students a choice among different possible answers and ask them to vote on the options. Similarly, use the answers to a multiple-choice item in this fashion. Many teachers use whole-class response systems such as individual whiteboards or electronic responding devices ("clickers").
- Establish discussion norms for the class so that all contributions are treated respectfully.

#### **Wait Time**

In the traditional model of questioning in the classroom, teachers typically wait less than one second after posing a question before calling for a response. This limited amount of think time encourages responses that are brief and right-answer oriented, rather than reflective and thought out, even if the question calls for mental processing. In studying the effects of increasing wait time on science achievement at the elementary, middle school, and high school levels, researchers found that when teachers pause after asking a question, student answers reflect deeper levels of thinking (Rowe, 1972, 1987).

Increasing the wait time from three and seven seconds results in an increase in:

- **1.** The length of student responses
- **2.** The number of unsolicited responses
- **3.** The frequency of student questions
- **4.** The number of responses from [lower-achieving students]
- **5.** Student-student interactions
- **6.** The incidence of speculative responses (Akron Global Polymer Academy, 2011, n.p.)

The benefits also occur when teachers give wait time *after* a student responds to a question, pausing before offering a response or calling on another student (Akron Global Polymer Academy, 2011).
When students first experience extended wait time, they have a tendency to respond by waiting rather than by thinking. It is a good idea to explain that the pause isn't really "wait" time in the sense that we're all waiting for a count of seven before firing off responses. Instead it is "think" time: the intent of the pause is to give each student time to ponder the question and formulate a response, which may be an answer, a question, or a comment that offers further reflection on the question.

Unless your goal is truly to get students to "popcorn" fast correct answers, pause between three and seven seconds before calling for responses. Wait time will increase the depth of thought, richness of discussion, and instructional value of your questions. Let students know what you are doing and why to help them understand what is expected of them during wait time.

### **PERSONAL COMMUNICATION OPTIONS: INSTRUCTIONAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS**

With this much-used personal communication option, as instruction proceeds, we pose questions for students to answer, or we ask students to pose questions and respond to each other. Its use in the classroom is primarily formative. We ask questions to gain information about students' learning in order to plan or adjust instruction. We listen to answers, interpret them (either by means of internally held standards or a written rubric), infer students' levels of attainment or misconceptions, and act accordingly. A second, equally important formative use of questioning is to encourage thinking and deepen learning. Instructional questions and answers typically focus on *knowledge* and *reasoning* learning targets. Responses to knowledge questions are judged correct or not, while reasoning probes need to be evaluated in terms of the quality of the reasoning demonstrated (as depicted in the rubrics in Chapter 6 .) While you are asking instructional questions, you won't necessarily be reading from a rubric to evaluate student responses, but it is a good idea to have the features of quality for the specific pattern of reasoning in mind. In other words, the rubric does not need to be in your hand, but it should be in your head.

Because we are so familiar with this format, it may not seem obvious to look for ways to improve it. In this section, we will look at strengthening the power of our instructional questions in assessing students' level of understanding or misconceptions, in spurring livelier discussions, and in encouraging deeper thinking.

#### **Developing Questions to Assess Knowledge and Understanding**

Instructional questions designed to assess students' levels of knowledge and understanding can be thought of as an oral version of selected response or written response assessment. There are two keys to using questions in this context:

- Plan key questions in advance of instruction to ensure they align with the target.
- Ask clear, brief questions that help students focus on a relatively narrow range of acceptable responses.

You can use the guidelines explained in Chapters 5 and 6 to assist with developing these questions. Ask them during the course of instruction using the suggestions offered previously for sampling and wait time, determine what students know and understand and what they don't, and adjust the lesson accordingly. Remember that in a group setting, instructional questions and answers are best used formatively.

#### **Developing Questions to Assess Reasoning**

Assessing reasoning through personal communication requires a well-thought-out question as well as the strategic use of wait (or "think") time, as described earlier. The guidelines in Chapters 5 and 6 can help you craft these questions. Here are three additional suggestions for success:

- Label the type of reasoning that you are looking for—comparing, analyzing, evaluating, and so forth—and include the specific reasoning verb in the question. Figure 8.3 shows key verbs and question stems targeted to elicit specific types of thinking.
- When students have difficulty responding to a question, rephrase it and ask again before offering clues to the answer.
- Invite students to elaborate. For example, say, "Please say a little more about . . ." This encourages students to develop more complex contributions.

#### **Suggestions for Effective Formative Use of Instructional Questions**

When we use personal communication as assessment *for* learning, we are using the questions themselves to teach and deepen knowledge, understanding, and reasoning proficiencies. There are a few classroom dynamics that can foster or hinder this. First, we need to make sure students feel safe in responding honestly even though they may not have confidence in the accuracy of their response. We create safe learning environments when we let students know that it is a good and desirable thing to uncover what we don't know and then go about learning it. Secondly, we need to help students understand that a response that misrepresents the truth about their achievement only gets in the way of their ultimate success as learners. Thirdly, we need to establish expectations that students will treat each others' contributions with respect as well, welcoming mistakes and misconceptions as opportunities to gain deeper understanding.

Here are some ways to maximize the learning students experience as a result of instructional questions:

- **1.** Ask questions that elicit summaries or key points of the learning.
- **2.** Encourage students to interact with each others' responses rather than looking to the teacher as their only responder.
- **3.** Model the response patterns that you'd like to see from students. For example:
	- Speculate on a given topic. This encourages students to explore ideas and understand that uncertainty is a normal stage in the thinking process.
	- Reflect on topics. For example, say, "I sometimes wonder . . ." This encourages students to explore the topic rather than to seek a single quick answer.
	- Cheerfully admit when you don't have an answer and model what to do about it. Follow "I'm not sure" with "What could we do to find out?" Sometimes a class member or two will be able to answer a question you can't, in which case invite students to weigh in.
- **4.** Teach students the question stems that elicit different patterns of reasoning for whatever content they are studying. Have them use question stems in small- or large-group discussions.

 Johnston (2004) has collected question stems that engender open-ended assessment*for* -learning conversations:

**To help students notice and learn:**
- Did anyone notice that . . . ?
- Remember how you used to . . . Now you . . . Notice the difference?
- What kind of . . . is this?
- What . . . surprised you?

**To establish student control:**
- How did you figure that out?
- What problems did you come across today?
- How are you planning to go about this?
- What parts are you sure (not sure) about?

**To help students transfer:**
- How else . . . ?
- What's that like?
- What if things changed . . . ?

**To help students confirm knowing:**
- How do you know we got this right?
- I hadn't thought about it that way. How did you know?
- How could we check?
- Would you agree with that? (pp. 13–59 passim)

These and similar questions can provide an excellent basis from which to encourage students to think aloud in conversation with you about their thinking and learning.

 **My Classroom Then and Now 8.1**
**Jody Petry**
I used to . . .

I used to "drive through" my curriculum. When planning classroom activities and assignments, I would plan them with me (the teacher) in mind. I used my lesson plans as simply a list of things to do. Once an assignment or activity was taught, I would move on—keep driving and not look back. I was essentially the driver, with the map, and my students were in the backseat. Since I was in charge of the learning, conversations during learning were shallow. The students didn't have the knowledge of their learning to talk about.

Now I . . .

Assessment *for* learning practices have given me the tools to hand over the learning to my students, essentially putting them in charge. They are the drivers and I am in the backseat. They are holding the "map" (learning targets). My students know where their learning is headed. Learning targets have given my students the knowledge they need to have in order to talk about what they are learning and what they need to work on. Using "I can" statements, my students know what it is they are supposed to know.

Why I changed . . .

Before, students were unable to tell me what they were not understanding in relationship to a concept we were working on. I could see how they weren't sure of what they were supposed to know. After learning more about assessment *for*  learning, I noticed all of the holes in my instruction. I found out how to connect my teaching with students' learning.

What I notice as a result . . .

Students can now name their learning. Using learning targets has given my students the power when it comes to their learning. They are able to tell what it is they need to know and what it is that they need to improve. My students have more in-depth conversations about learning, using rich academic vocabulary in group discussions. My students are now equipped to give focused feedback about where they are in their learning. Using a 1 through 4 scale, students can gauge their understanding of the material.

#### **Summative Use of Instructional Questions**

 We caution against using questions asked during group instruction as summative data about an individual student's knowledge or reasoning proficiencies. It is difficult to obtain accurate information in this context due to sampling constraints and the sources of bias that the group setting introduces. It is better to ask the questions in the one-on-one setting offered by an oral examination, as described later in this chapter.

### **PERSONAL COMMUNICATION OPTIONS: CLASS DISCUSSIONS**

With this option, students converse with one another in a structured discussion. Class discussions can serve formative or summative purposes. Whether to use them formatively or summatively depends in part on the intended purpose and learning target. In this case, the evaluation of student contributions requires forethought about the criteria by which we judge the quality of those contributions. Typically, this requires the development of a rubric. Depending on the context, students can contribute to the development of that rubric, thus turning assessment development into an assessment *for* learning intervention.

When students participate in class discussions, their contributions can reveal a great deal about their levels of knowledge, conceptual understanding, and reasoning abilities, which can help you plan further instruction. Class discussions have the simultaneous effect of enhancing understanding and reasoning proficiency. These are both formative uses.

Discussions can be used to provide evidence of *knowledge* and *reasoning* targets for summative use as well, but there are serious limitations in terms of sampling and sources of bias to consider. Because there are better options in most cases for evaluating knowledge and reasoning targets when the intended use is summative, we recommend that you use class discussions formatively to diagnose and deepen knowledge, understanding, and reasoning.

However, if your curriculum includes a communication *skill* target, such as one specifying that students be able to participate effectively in discussions, you will need to assess it for a grade. The target may require students to demonstrate their level of achievement of discussion skills, and perhaps also their ability to employ underpinning knowledge and reasoning proficiencies.

A good example of this kind of target is a College and Career Readiness Anchor Standard (applies across grades 6–12) for Speaking and Listening from the Common Core State Standards for English/Language Arts & Literacy in History, Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects: "Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively" (CCSSI, 2010a, p. 48 ).

The grade-specific standards that flesh this target out at the eighth-grade level say this:

- **a.** Come to discussions prepared, having read or researched material under study; explicitly draw on that preparation by referring to evidence on the topic, text, or issue to probe and reflect on ideas under discussion.
- **b.** Follow rules for collegial discussions and decision-making, track progress toward specific goals and deadlines, and define individual roles as needed.
- **c.** Pose questions that connect the ideas of several speakers and respond to others' questions and comments with relevant observations and ideas.
- **d.** Acknowledge new information expressed by others and, when warranted, justify or qualify their own views in light of the evidence presented. (CCSSI, 2010a, p. 49)

As with all skill targets, assessing this standard summatively will require a scoring rubric that clearly describes each of its components at several levels of achievement. And it would be wise to engage students in practice discussions with opportunities for feedback and revision, prior to evaluating their discussion proficiencies for a grade.

#### **Developing Class Discussion Topics and Questions**

To take advantage of the strengths of this method of assessment while minimizing the impact of potential weaknesses, do the following:

- Prepare questions or discussion issues in advance to focus on the intended achievement target. Use the suggestions in Chapter 6 for developing written response questions as a springboard for crafting questions that will lead to rich discussion and also stay within the bounds of the learning the discussion is intended to focus on.
- Find, modify, or develop scoring checklists or rubrics that reflect the learning targets at the heart of the discussion task. See Chapter 7 for how to do this. If possible, work with colleagues to practice evaluating recorded student discussion sessions to ensure inter-rater reliability when judging level of achievement.
- In contexts where achievement information derived from participation in discussion will be used summatively, rely on more than your memory. Track individual student achievement with a scoring checklist or rubric and keep dependable records of performance. Also, electronic tools that can help with this function have recently come on the market and may be available in your school.

#### **Suggestions for Effective Use of Class Discussions**

Be sure students are aware of what they will be judged on, which should match the learning targets you have shared with them at the outset of instruction. Are you evaluating the *content* of students' contributions—the knowledge, understanding, or reasoning demonstrated—or the *form* of their contribution—how they communicate, or

 **FAQ 8.1 Keeping Track**
Question:
*Do we need to keep track of personal communication information?* 

Answer:
When the information is to be used only over a span of a few moments or hours on narrow targets, formal record keeping is usually unnecessary. When the context includes many students, complex targets, and a requirement of later use, we must absolutely keep track of results. Because there are no artifacts to refer to for later use, records of achievement must be managed carefully. This process is helped by high-quality rubrics for the reasoning or skill targets being discussed or observed. You may also want to make a video record, especially if discussion skills are the focus, if you are planning to use the information as a part of a course grade. Options for tracking formative and summative information once you have captured it are discussed in Chapter 9 .

some combination of both? This focus should derive directly from the learning targets students know they are expected to master.

To increase student achievement, use Strategies 1 through 4 from the Seven Strategies of Assessment *for* Learning, as explained in Chapter 7 :

- **1.** Introduce the language and concepts of the rubric.
- **2.** Use strong and weak examples.
- **3.** Offer feedback focused on one aspect of quality at a time. Teach students to give each other feedback based on the rubric.
- **4.** Teach students to self-assess and set goals with the rubric.

**For Example 8.1 Line-up**

A line-up is an activity that structures a class discussion so that students talk to each other to investigate a question or argument. The line-up teaches students to examine both sides of an issue or argument before committing to one side. It also helps correct the misconception that opinions can be effectively supported with further opinions, or that the volume with which an opinion is expressed constitutes support.

In the example used, students are learning to develop arguments for and against a position.

- **1.** The teacher identifies a statement that could be argued reasonably for or against. This works best if there is no "right" or "wrong" side. For example, after reading a short story about a boy who lies to cover up the fact that he didn't get into the highly competitive school his father attended, the teacher may post the statement, "Parents should push their children."
- **2.** The teacher and students clear a space so that students are able to form two lines facing each other. The teacher posts the statement on the wall at one end of the cleared space, also posting two signs, "Yes" and "No," one on each side of the statement.
- **3.** Students form two lines facing each other, one line extending from the "Yes" sign and the other extending from the "No" sign. The teacher can let students choose which side reflects their own position or can number students by twos and assign them a position.
- **4.** The discussion begins, following these rules:

One person talks at a time.
After one person from one side has talked, it is the other side's turn. The comment may be a counterargument, a question, or a new argument.
Share the talking time fairly. A goal is to hear as many diverse arguments as possible.
Talk to those in the other line, not to the teacher.
The teacher doesn't talk, except to remind of the rules.
Comments should explain reasons for the position, for or against.
The same comment should not be repeated. Once a reason has been shared, if a person wants to share it again, the new comment must include an elaboration.
Stating a comment at a louder volume does not make it a stronger reason.

- **5.** If a person wants to make a comment in support of the other line's position, he or she walks over to the other line and makes it. (When students do this, it may require a little norming about turn-taking while talking.)
- **6.** To debrief this activity, students identify the strongest arguments for and against in small groups and then share their thoughts in the large group. They may then be asked to take a position and defend it in writing.

As a variation, students can line up according to the intensity of their commitment to the side they have chosen. At first this may produce the two lines forming a "U" shape, with lots of students on the fence—the bottom of the "U." Consider not offering this option until they have participated in a line-up a few times and have become more comfortable taking a position in public.

### **PERSONAL COMMUNICATION OPTIONS: CONFERENCES AND INTERVIEWS**

With this personal communication option, we meet with students individually to talk about what they have learned and have yet to learn. We tend to use these formatively to provide insights that both we and the student may use to guide further learning. In the context of a conference or interview, we can assess students' grasp of *knowledge* targets and proficiency with *reasoning* targets. Conferring individually with students is a powerful assessment *for* learning tool when we ask carefully thought-out followup questions to uncover strengths and misconceptions or misunderstandings.

In addition, we can probe whether students have the underlying knowledge, conceptual understanding, and reasoning proficiencies necessary for successful demonstration of skill and product targets. Although the conversation itself will not provide sufficient evidence to judge level of attainment of skill and product targets, it can be used to diagnose underlying instructional needs and plan for interventions.

Conferences and interviews need not be standardized or conducted with every pupil. We might meet with only one student or vary the focus of the conference with students who have different needs.

#### **Developing Questions and Topics for Conferences and Interviews**

The goal of a conference or interview is to establish a deeper understanding of the student as a learner, so you will want to create questions that cause the student to do most of the talking. Here are some keys to developing a question framework to guide the discussion:

- Carefully think out and plan questions in advance.
- Avoid asking "yes" or "no" questions.
- Develop questions that focus attention on the student's progress toward preestablished learning targets.
- Have samples of student work available to add specificity to the discussion. Make sure the student understands which learning targets the samples provide evidence of. Also have available the rubrics used to evaluate them, as appropriate.

In Chapter 11 we offer suggestions for a variety of ways to collect student work into portfolios that can become the basis for the conference discussion. That chapter also includes lists of questions that initiate student self-analysis of learning strategies, skills, and processes. In Chapter 12 we offer more in-depth information about kinds of conferences and options for conducting them.

#### **Suggestions for Effective Use of Conferences and Interviews**

One important advantage of the conference or interview as a mode of assessment lies in the impact it can have on our relationships with students. When students understand the achievement target and the formative intent of the discussion, this form of assessment becomes "sitting beside" in truth, with both teacher and student working together for the individual student's good. In addition, an effective conference or interview sets students up to take more ownership of their learning progress.

The following are keys to successful use of conference and interview assessment formats:

- Let students know in advance the purpose and the focus for the conference or interview to minimize the chance that they will think they are "in trouble" because they have to talk to the teacher.
- Give students an opportunity to prepare for the conference or interview. What questions might they have? What materials might they want to bring?
- Plan for enough uninterrupted time to complete the discussion. Prioritize your questions if you are concerned about running out of time.
- Give students plenty of responding time. Listen carefully to what they say. Feeling "heard" helps students trust that the purpose of the conference or interview is to engender mutual understanding of the student's learning strengths and needs. Anne Davies (Davies & Stiggins, 1996) suggests sitting on your left hand to remind yourself to listen.
- Conclude each meeting with a summary of the lessons learned and their implications for future actions. Let the student do the summarizing orally or in writing, as appropriate.

### **PERSONAL COMMUNICATION OPTIONS: ORAL EXAMINATIONS**

When personal communication takes the form of an oral examination, we plan and pose questions for students, who reflect and provide oral responses. We listen to and interpret the responses, evaluating quality and inferring levels of achievement using scoring guides like those of the written response exam or a performance assessment. Oral examinations are generally used summatively. They can reliably measure *knowledge* and *reasoning* targets and can also measure *skill* targets that require one-to-one communication, such as correct pronunciation in a foreign language. Oral examination questions are structured similarly to selected response questions, short-answer and extended written response items, and performance assessments, but they have the added benefit of allowing us to ask followup questions to attain greater accuracy of results.

#### **Developing Questions for Oral Examinations**

Quality control guidelines for oral examinations include those listed in Chapters 5 and 6 for selected response and written response assessments as well as some guidelines particular to this form of assessment, as follows:

- Develop questions that focus on the desired learning target(s).
- Ask questions using the easiest possible vocabulary and grammatical construction. Don't let language get in the way of allowing students to show what they know.
- If the question is to be used to assess mastery of a combination of knowledge and reasoning targets, use the formula explained in Chapter 6 : Identify the knowledge to be brought to bear, specify the kind of reasoning students are to use, and identify the standards you will apply in evaluating responses.
- Present one set of questions to all students; don't offer choices of questions to answer.
- Develop scoring checklists or rubrics that describe levels of quality in a response in advance of the assessment. Be sure that qualified experts in the field would agree with the features of a sound response. See Chapters 6 and 7 for guidance on how to do this.
- Your scoring checklists or rubrics should allow you to separate achievement on knowledge and reasoning targets from facility with verbal expression so that students aren't able to do well on the exam without having mastered the targets.
- Prepare in advance to accommodate the needs of any students who may confront language proficiency barriers.
- Have a method of recording results ready to use at the time of the assessment.
- If necessary, audiotape responses for later reevaluation.

#### **Suggestions for Effective Use of Oral Examinations**

Just as with selected response, written response, and performance assessments, students will benefit from an opportunity to practice demonstrating their learning in this format, with feedback prior to sitting for an oral examination that will be used as a part of their grade. For an example of how an oral examination might be used both for practice and to contribute to a final grade, consider the test developed by a foreign language teacher for her first-year students. One of the important learning targets for the term was to engage in short social conversations with a range of vocabulary and sentence constructions. The teacher identified the contexts in which students were to learn to converse (e.g., meeting someone for the first time, talking about your school, talking about your family, asking directions), and students practiced the discussions with each other over the course of the term. As part of the final exam, the teacher drew one of the topics at random for each student, who then was responsible for conducting the conversation.

### **PERSONAL COMMUNICATION OPTIONS: JOURNALS AND LOGS**

Sometimes personal communication takes a written form: students write to explain, explore, or deepen their own knowledge and understanding and the teacher or another student responds. Journals and logs are used for a variety of reasons in the classroom. This section addresses their use as a structured interaction with the teacher or another student, where students describe their views, experiences, reactions, insights, understandings, confusions, and misunderstandings related to specific learning targets. Thus, their primary use as an assessment option is formative ( Figure 8.4 ). As assessment tools, journals and logs are especially well suited to focusing on knowledge and reasoning learning targets. In this section we will discuss four types of journals and logs: *response journals* , *dialogue journals* , *personal journals* , and *learning logs* .

#### **Response Journals**

Response journals are most often used in situations where we ask students to read and construct meaning from text, such as in the context of reading and English language arts. In any subject, students can record responses to ideas in a text, to an experience, to what they are viewing, or to what they are listening to. Typically, we provide structured assignments to guide their responses.

Here are some examples from English language arts:

- Describe characters in terms of key attributes or contribution to the story.
- Trace an evolving story line, plot, or story events.
- Note the questions that come to you as you are reading.
- Compare one character to another.
- Anticipate or predict upcoming events.
- Evaluate either the piece as whole or specific parts in terms of appropriate criteria.
- Suggest ways to change or improve character, plot, or setting. Give reasons for your suggestions.

**FIGURE 8.4** Written Forms of Personal Communication

Response Journals
Students record their responses to ideas in a text, in what they are viewing, listening to, or experiencing.
Dialogue Journals
Students write messages conveying thoughts and ideas about what they are learning. Teachers respond. Students may reply to the response.
*Personal Journals*
Students write regularly in a journal to refl ect on ideas, on their learning, or on themselves as learners.
*Learning Logs*
Students keep ongoing records to document learning, progress made, and processes used.

**ASSESSMENT** *FOR* **LEARNING WITH RESPONSE JOURNALS.** One interesting example of the use of a response journal to help students learn more deeply comes from Janice Knight: "Most students' initial efforts at writing journal entries were lengthy, literal accounts about what was read. These boring responses, displaying a lack of critical thinking, filled page after page in their journals. It seemed that demonstration lessons on how to [think more deeply] were needed" (1990, p. 42 ). So she taught students how to use a system for coding their journal entries for the types of thinking displayed. She taught the codes one at a time, first modeling and then having students practice writing about what they read, coding for that type of thinking. By doing this, she saw a dramatic increase in the depth of thinking displayed in journal entries. "(N)ot only does the teacher have a record of the type of thinking that went into their creation, so do the students. They can readily self-evaluate and work independently towards improving their responses. The students are also more motivated to include different kinds of thinking in their entries" (1990, p. 42 ).

#### **Dialogue Journals**

Dialogue journals capture conversations between students and teachers in writing. As teaching and learning proceed, students write messages to us conveying thoughts and ideas about the achievement expected, self-evaluations of progress, points of confusion, or important new insights. Periodically, they turn the journals in and we read them and reply, responding to an idea, asking a question, clarifying or amplifying a key point. Students read what we have written, sometimes responding, and other times moving on to a new topic. This process links us with each student in a supportive communication partnership.

#### **Personal Journals**

Personal journals represent the least structured of the journal options. In this case, we give students time during each day (or week) to write in their journals. It is important to establish a clear purpose and audience for personal journals at the outset. They can either be used to help us understand each student's level of understanding or to give students an opportunity to respond to or reflect on the day's (or week's) learning.

When the purpose is to give the teacher insight into student level of understanding, we specify the topic and read what they have written to determine what instruction they need next. We may or may not comment in the journal, depending on what we decide to do with the information given. If only a few students exhibit a misunderstanding and a remark, question, or reminder will clear it up, we may choose to comment. If students' personal journals exhibit strong understanding, we may choose to note that. If, based on what we read, we decide to reteach, a comment may not be necessary.

On the other hand, when the writing is solely for the student's use—to question, track, or reflect—then if we read the journals we comment only at the invitation of the student.

#### **Learning Logs**

Learning logs ask students to keep ongoing written records of the following aspects of their studies:

- Achievement targets they have mastered
- Learning targets they have found useful and important
- Learning targets they are having difficulty mastering
- Learning experiences or instructional strategies that worked particularly well for them
- Learning experiences or instructional strategies that were confusing or difficult for them
- Processes they are trying, including problems and successes
- Questions that have come up along the way that they want help with
- Ideas for important study topics or learning strategies that they might like to try in the future

The goal in the case of learning logs is to have students reflect on, analyze, describe, and evaluate their learning experiences, successes, and challenges, communicating the conclusions they are in the process of drawing about the learning and about themselves as learners. This is the heart of assessment *for* learning as we describe it.

### **POSSIBLE SOURCES OF BIAS THAT CAN DISTORT RESULTS**

There are several potential sources of bias that might distort the results of personal communication assessment. Some have to do with the quality of the ingredients that make up the assessment, while others can arise from the inherently subjective nature of the scoring process. We prevent the first kind of problem with careful development or selection of probes. We avoid the second through the development of high-quality scoring guides and careful preparation to apply them dependably.

Since personal communication overlaps with performance assessment, when assessing oral skills such as group discussion skills and second-language fluency, this method can fall prey to the same sorts of problems as performance assessment—tasks that don't elicit the needed performance, poor or nonexistent performance criteria and rubrics, and lack of consistency in using rubrics.

Also, because personal communication overlaps with selected response and written response assessment, when focused on knowledge and reasoning targets, it can fall into the same traps, such as unclear questions, poor or nonexistent scoring guides and rubrics, lack of the English skills needed to demonstrate learning, and questions that don't make clear the knowledge to be brought to bear, the kind of reasoning to use, or the standards to be used in evaluating responses.

Adhering to standards of assessment quality for selected response, written response, and performance assessment will help minimize or avoid these sources of bias ( Figure 8.5 ).

**FIGURE 8.5** Sources of Bias with Personal Communication  
*Problems with the context*  
Insufficient wait time 
Students not understanding what to do with wait time 
Lack of student's English language skills  
*Problems with the question or task*  
Questions are not aligned with the intended learning Unclear questions 
Unclear directions Unclear expectations 
Task doesn't elicit the intended performance 
Task is poorly constructed  
*Problems with interpreting levels of student performance*  
Poor or nonexistent scoring guides and rubrics Lack of consistency in using scoring rubrics  
*Problems with using the information*  
Insufficient sample size to support intended use 
Lack of accurate and effi cient record-keeping system

#### **Reminder of Problems and Solutions**

Here are some of the problems that can arise from the subjectivity of personal communication methods.

*Problem* : Trying to remember everything without writing it down is a recipe for mismeasurement if there is an extended time between assessment and ultimate evaluation as in the case of report card grading.

*Solution* : Keeping good written records is essential if you are planning to use the information beyond the immediate context.

*Problem* : Unconscious personal and professional filters, developed over years of experience, through which we hear and process student responses also can contribute to mismeasurement. We develop such filters as efficient ways to process large quantities of information, but sometimes they backfire. For example, if we have come to expect excellent work from a student, we might overlook a lapse in understanding by inferring that the student actually had the understanding but unintentionally left the information out of an explanation. These same filters may cause us to provide more clues to some students than to others without realizing it, thereby causing the assessment task to vary in level of difficulty unintentionally.

*Solution* : A good scoring rubric and attention to record keeping can help overcome these problems.

*Problem* : Unexamined stereotypes might come into play, distorting results. If we're not expecting a person to be good at spatial reasoning, we might underrate what we actually hear. If a student appears defiant, we might unintentionally shade our judgment of the quality of the student's contribution to a group discussion.

*Solution* : A good scoring rubric and attention to record keeping can help overcome these problems.

*Problem* : Group discussion can also fall prey to sources of bias due to student characteristics. A quiet person who knows the material might be too uncomfortable or otherwise unwilling to speak up in a group. If the goal of the discussion is to assess understanding of the material, we may make an incorrect inference about that student's level of achievement.

*Solution* : Keep in mind that the public display of achievement or lack thereof is risky for some students. Provide those students with other, more private means of demonstrating their level of achievement if you are unable to get accurate achievement information in a group discussion context.

*Problem* : Assessing achievement during a group discussion can result in inaccurate results due to inadequacies in sampling. Even though we are observing the group, we might miss a student's finest moment or not see typical performance because there are too many students to watch or too many things to watch for. Or the discussion time may be too limited, rendering our sample too small to make a good inference about student achievement.

*Solution* : We must attend carefully to sampling issues when planning to use data obtained from observation of group discussion.

### **Summary**

Personal communication assessment is an efficient and effective way to both gather information about students to plan your next instructional steps, and to involve students in their own assessment. Personal communication can be used to collect information about knowledge, reasoning, and level of certain skills such as ability to speak a foreign language.

There are several different ways to collect information through interpersonal communication—instructional questions and answers, conferences and interviews, classroom discussions, oral examinations, and journals and logs. Some of these are oral and some are written.

Personal communication forms of assessment must adhere to standards of sound assessment practice. Teachers must base them on a clear idea of which learning targets are to be the focus, have a clear purpose for gathering the information, and attend to possible sources of bias that could lead to misinterpretation of student learning.

As with other forms of assessment, personal communication can be used as a platform for formative assessment and student involvement. Because of the similarities between short oral answers and selected response written questions, extended oral responses and extended written response, and personal communication and performance assessment, strategies for student involvement outlined in Chapters 5 , 6 , and 7 can also be used with personal communication. In this chapter we provided activities to involve students in the oral questioning of each other, using journal icons to deepen thinking, and using a group discussion rubric to promote better group discussions.

##### **Activity 8.5 Conduct a Line-up Discussion**

After reading the description of a "line-up" discussion in For Example 8.1 , work independently, with a partner, or with a team to plan and conduct a line-up with your students.

**Prepare**
- **1.** Review the learning targets in your curriculum that call for this type of reasoning or discussion skill. Identify the learning target(s) that will be the focus of the activity.
- **2.** Select a context suited to students' exploration of multiple perspectives.
- **3.** Generate several options for your "line-up" statement. These are statements that a reasonable person could support or disagree with. Test them out with a partner or team, if possible. Can you think of good arguments for both sides? Select the one that provides the richest discussion fodder. Write it on a piece of construction paper in big enough letters to be read from across the room.
- **4.** Make a "Yes" sign and a "No" sign (or "Agree" and "Disagree" signs).
- **5.** Plan for how you will debrief the activity. Make sure the debriefing process brings attention back to the intended learning that caused you to conduct the line-up. Also plan for any followup assignments you may wish to give to capitalize on the thought generated during the activity.
- **6.** Clear a space in your room big enough to accommodate the students in your class standing in two rows facing each other. Remember that for a number of statements the class will divide unevenly. If you anticipate a grossly uneven division, consider numbering the students by twos and assigning them involuntarily to the "yes" and "no" lines. This helps those who are in the "wrong" line think of counterarguments to their own position.
- **7.** Post the "line-up" statement on a wall centered in the cleared space. Post the "Yes" and "No" signs three to five feet on either side of the line-up statement.

**Conduct**
- **8.** Explain to students the purpose of the line-up, the intended learning, and the directions.
- **9.** Have students line up and share reasons that support the position of their line.
- **10.** Make sure you don't reinforce or contradict anyone's comments. Speak only to re-establish the rules. When students attempt to convince you, rather than their peers, nonverbally direct them to talk to "the line."

**Debrief**
**11.** Have students form small groups and discuss what they thought were the strongest arguments for and against the line-up statement. Then have them engage in an activity that connects the discussion to the intended learning. Last, you may want to give them an assignment directed at the learning target that applies the thoughts they generated during the line-up.
**12.** Discuss the classroom experience with a partner or a team. What learning target was the focus of the line-up activity? What question did you use? How did the question work? What were the students' responses to the activity? Did it deepen thought and broaden engagement? What did you do with students to debrief it? Would you make changes to the question, the protocol, or the debriefing process as a result of this experience? Would you do it another time with a different question? What learning targets will these discussions address?

Student Directions for the Line-up

##### **Activity 8.6 Develop Oral Examination Questions**

Work independently, with a partner, or with a team to carry out the following activity.

- **1.** After reading the section titled "Personal Communication Options: Oral Examinations," select a learning target or cluster of learning targets that is suited to assessment via oral examination.
- **2.** Determine whether you will use the information generated from the examination formatively or summatively.
- **3.** Create a test blueprint using one of the two forms explained in Chapter 4(or a version of one of them).
- **4.** Use the assessment development guidelines from Chapters 5 , 6 , and/or 7to create questions and/or prompts for your oral examination. Which chapter's information you use is determined by the kind of learning target(s) you will be assessing. If the oral examination will include answers that go beyond the range of right or wrong, also develop a scoring checklist or rubric as described in Chapters 6and 7 .
- **5.** Determine how you will record your judgments of student achievement. Plan for how you will share the results with students.
- **6.** Administer the assessment, attending to relevant sources of bias.
- **7.** Keep track of any problems you noticed with the assessment itself, problems students had in responding, or problems with recording and communicating results.
- **8.** Debrief the assessment experience with a partner or with your team. Were the results of the oral examination to be used formatively or summatively? What learning targets were the focus of the examination? What questions did you ask? How did you evaluate responses? What records did you keep? What worked well? What would you revise for future use?

##### **Activity 8.7 Use Journals or Logs in the Classroom**

Work independently, with a partner, or with a team to carry out the following activity.

- **1.** After reading the section titled "Personal Communication Options: Journals and Logs," select a learning target or a collection of learning targets, such as those from a unit of study as the focus for the journal or log.
- **2.** Determine your rationale for asking students to keep a journal or log.
- **3.** Determine which written communication format is best suited to your students, your intended use of the communication, and the learning target(s): response journals, dialogue journals, personal journals, or learning logs. (For descriptions of each format, refer to Figure 8.4 .)
- **4.** Read through Chapter 11to get a sense of the options for prompts and instructions you might give to students for their entries.
- **5.** Think about how much individuality, freedom, and choice students might be able to exercise and still accomplish the desired outcome of journal or log keeping. Build in as much student ownership in as the learning targets and your goals for doing this allow.
- **6.** Decide what form their journals or logs will take—notebook, spiral-bound booklet, personally created booklet, folder of loose pages, computer file, other? Assemble any materials needed.
- **7.** Estimate how often students will be asked to make entries. Determine who will respond and approximately how often. Possible audiences are you, other students, and parents as well, again depending on the intent of the communication.
- **8.** Write the instructions you will give to students to guide their entries. Include the following:
	- The intended learning targets and the rationale for keeping a journal or log
	- The types of entries you will ask them to make and how often
	- Who will read them and how often
	- How you and other readers will respond
	- What you will do with the information they share
	- Any other guidance your students will need to maximize their success at this communication project
- **9.** At the conclusion of the journal/log project, reflect on its impact on student learning. What did you notice happening with students as a result? What information did this type of personal communication give you that you might otherwise not have had? What worked well for you? What would you change? Make a note of these insights for future use if you intend to use journals or logs again.

##### **Activity 8.8 Reflect on Your Own Learning**

Review the Chapter 8learning targets and select one or more that represented new learning for you or struck you as most significant from this chapter. If you are working individually, write a short reflection that captures your current understanding. If you are working with a partner or a team, either discuss what you have written or use this as a discussion prompt for a team meeting.

Reflect on Chapter 8 Learning

##### **Activity 8.9 Select Portfolio Artifacts**

Any of the activities from this chapter can be used as portfolio entries. Select activities you have completed or artifacts you have created that will illustrate your competence at the Chapter 8learning targets:

- **1.** Frame questions to be used diagnostically to inform instruction.
- **2.** Use questioning strategies to deepen students' understanding and reasoning proficiencies.
- **3.** Structure class discussions for formative and summative use.
- **4.** Conduct conferences, interviews, and oral exams to obtain accurate information about student achievement.
- **5.** Use student journals and logs as assessment *for* learning tools.

If you are keeping a reflective journal, you may want to include Chapter 8 's entry in your portfolio.
