## Chapter 3: Clear Targets
 *Students can hit any target they can see and that holds still for them.* 

*What do we want students to know and be able to do?* In standards-based schools, what students are to learn drives all planning, instruction, and assessment. The curriculum documents are the roadmap we use and assessment is the global positioning system that guides us to our destination. Just as the GPS we use in our cars relies on an accurate map to accomplish its task, effective formative and summative assessment depend on the clear roadmap to important learning that a good curriculum provides.

Curriculum documents consist of statements of intended learning, known by more than a few labels. "Common Core State Standards," "content standards," "benchmarks," "grade level indicators," "grade level expectations," "essential learnings," "learning outcomes," "lesson objectives," "learning progressions," and "learning intentions" are a few examples. In this book we use one label to refer to these statements: *learning targets* .

Learning targets vary in complexity, clarity, and level of specificity. Some are written to represent the ultimate learning desired and others are written to reflect the day-to-day learning that students will engage in to reach the ultimate learning. When the content standards represented in our curricula aren't clear, they don't function as

*Learning targets are statements of the intended learning.*

effective roadmaps for instruction and assessment won't help us reach our destination. If the curriculum side of the classroom is in disarray, the assessment side will be equally messy; the accuracy of any assessment hinges on clear targets, as we will see in the following chapters.

In this chapter, we explain the different kinds of learning targets; how to make them clear to everyone, including students; the importance of clear learning targets to teaching and learning; and how clear targets are a necessary foundation for classroom assessment quality. It focuses on the shaded portion of Figure 3.1 .

### **Chapter 3 Learning Targets**

At the end of this chapter, you will know how to do the following:

- Explain the connection between clear targets and assessment quality.
- Classify learning targets by type.
- Determine whether your learning targets are clear to you and to students.
- Clarify and deconstruct learning targets as needed.
- Create student-friendly versions of learning targets as needed.

 **FIGURE 3.1** Keys to Quality Classroom Assessment

**Key 1: Clear Purpose** Who will use the information? How will they use it? What information, in what detail, is required?

**Key 2: Clear Targets** Are learning targets clear to teachers? What kinds of achievement are to be assessed? Are these learning targets the focus of instruction?

**Key 3: Sound Design**

Do assessment methods match learning targets? Does the sample represent learning appropriately? Are items, tasks, and scoring rubrics of high quality? Does the assessment control for bias?

**Key 4: Effective Communication**

Can assessment results be used to guide instruction? Do formative assessments function as effective feedback? Is achievement tracked by learning target and reported by standard?

Do grades communicate achievement accurately?

**Key 5: Student Involvement**

Do assessment practices meet students' information needs? Are learning targets clear to students? Will the assessment yield information that students can use to self-assess and set goals? Are students tracking and communicating their evolving learning?

### **TYPES OF LEARNING TARGETS**

One way you will know that your targets are clear and usable is if you can determine what kind of learning is being called for. The accuracy of the assessments you develop will depend in part on your ability to classify learning targets in any written curriculum in a way that helps ensure a dependable assessment. We offer a categorization framework that identifies five kinds of learning targets: knowledge, reasoning,

*Classifying learning targets is a necessary step in planning an assessment. It helps identify the assessment options appropriate to each target.*

skill, product, and disposition, summarized in Figure 3.2 . Our purpose in categorizing learning targets is threefold. First, the process will be useful when examining the targets in your own curriculum to determine if they are clear enough. Second, if you need to deconstruct a content standard into smaller teachable parts, knowing the target type will help with identifying the enabling learning targets. Third, it is essential knowledge for selecting the appropriate assessment method, which is explained in Chapter 4 .

#### **Knowledge Targets**

 Knowledge targets include the factual information, procedural knowledge, and conceptual understandings that underpin each academic discipline. They are important because they form the foundation for each of the other types of targets—there is no

**FIGURE 3.2** Learning Target Types
**Knowledge Targets**
 Knowledge targets represent the factual information, procedural knowledge, and conceptual understandings that underpin each discipline.

**Reasoning Targets**

Reasoning targets specify thought processes students are to learn to do well within a range of subjects.

**Skill Targets**

Skill targets are those where a demonstration or physical skill-based performance is at the heart of the learning.

**Product Targets**

Product targets describe learning in terms of artifacts where creation of a product is the focus of the learning target. With product targets, the specifications for quality of the product itself are the focus of teaching and assessment.

**Disposition Targets**

Disposition targets refer to attitudes, motivations, and interests that affect students' approaches to learning. They represent important *affective* goals we hold for students as a byproduct of their educational experience.

such thing as knowledge-free reasoning, knowledge-free skilled performance, or knowledge-free product development.

**FACTUAL INFORMATION.** Targets calling for *factual information* are often stated using verbs such as *knows* , *lists, names, identifies,* and *recalls.* Examples include "Identify and know the meaning of the most common prefixes and derivational suffixes" (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2010a, p. 17 [hereafter cited as CCSSI, 2010a]), "Understand the absolute value of a rational number as its distance from 0 on the number line" (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2010c, p. 43 [hereafter cited as CCSSI, 2010c]), and "Knows the nutritional value of different foods" (Kendall & Marzano, 1997, p. 552).

Some learning targets call for *procedural knowledge* : knowing how to do something. They often begin with the phrase *knows how to* , or the word *uses* , such as the target "Uses scientific notation to represent very large and very small numbers." Procedural knowledge usually involves knowing a protocol or memorizing a series of steps.

**CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING.** When *conceptual understanding* is at the heart of a learning target, the target often begins with the word *understands* . A conceptual understanding learning target at the knowledge level means that the student can explain the concept. We would not consider this "low-level" knowledge; conceptual understanding is essential for reasoning effectively in any discipline. As the Common Core State Standards Initiative's description of the Standards for Mathematical Practice states: "Students who lack understanding of a topic may rely on procedures too heavily. Without a flexible base from which to work, they may be less likely to consider analogous problems, represent problems coherently, justify conclusions, apply the mathematics to practical situations, use technology mindfully to work with the mathematics, explain the mathematics accurately to other students, step back for an overview, or deviate from a known procedure to find a shortcut. In short, a lack of understanding effectively prevents a student from engaging in the mathematical practices" (CCSSI, 2010c, p. 8 ).

**KNOWING VIA REFERENCE.** Beyond knowing information outright, there is another way of knowing—knowing via reference. Not everything that we need to know needs to be learned "by heart." What, of the information students need, will we require they memorize, and what will we teach them to find if and when they need it? As our students become increasingly adept at using technology to search for information, we must carefully identify the information that it is important to have in memory. Will they memorize the list of prepositions ( *above, aboard, about* . . .)? The table of periodic elements? The capitals of the 50 U.S. states? Maybe, maybe not. As we know, there isn't enough time to teach (or for students to learn) everything of importance—we can easily fill the year teaching facts, thereby losing instructional time for learning targets beyond the knowledge level. Where is the balance? One way to address this problem is to determine which knowledge learning targets will be important for students to know outright and which they will be required to know via reference.

**CLASSIFYING TARGETS AS KNOWLEDGE.** Classifying learning targets isn't a 100 percent foolproof process. Sorting by the verb in the target works well most of the time, but not always. A target beginning with the word *knows* very often is, but may not be, a knowledge target. For example, consider the two targets "Knows how healthy practices enhance the ability to dance" and "Knows folk dances from various cultures" (Kendall & Marzano, 1997, pp. 387 , 386 ). Are they both knowledge targets? Before classifying each as *knowledge* because of the verb, we need to make sure that *knowledge* is the intent. "Knows how healthy practices enhance the ability to dance" is likely to be a knowledge target, but perhaps the intent of "knows folk dances from various cultures" is that students are able to perform a variety of folk dances. In that case, it is a skill target in its intent and should be rewritten to reflect that.

Sometimes a target that looks like procedural knowledge may not be. Consider the target "Knows how to narrow or broaden inquiry when appropriate." There is procedural knowledge involved, but figuring out when a topic is too broad or too narrow requires reasoning. And if the target's intent is that students actually broaden or narrow a topic, that is also reasoning. So while at first glance this may look like a knowledge target, it is in fact a reasoning target.

When a learning target begins with the word *understands* , it can either be a knowledge target or a reasoning target. Is the intent that students can explain something such as understanding of a concept? If so, it's a knowledge target. (Remember, calling it a knowledge target doesn't make it a simple target—in order to explain a concept clearly you have to know it well.) Or does the word *understand* in the context of the target call for reasoning in some way beyond an explanation? If so, it's a reasoning target.

 *Although looking to the verb often results in an accurate classification of a knowledge target, it's important to verify that knowledge is its intent.* 

#### **Reasoning Targets**

Reasoning targets specify thought processes students are to learn to apply effectively (do well) within a range of subjects; e.g., solve problems, make inferences, draw conclusions, form and defend judgments. Mastering content knowledge, while necessary, is not the sole aim of education today; more importantly, we want our students to develop the ability to *apply* knowledge in authentic contexts—that is, in contexts that transfer to work and life beyond school. This requires that they engage in reasoning using their knowledge.

All subject-area curricula include reasoning processes, such as *predict, infer, classify, hypothesize, compare, draw conclusions, summarize, estimate, solve problems, analyze, evaluate, justify,* and *generalize.* Reasoning processes can be thought of as falling into one of six overall patterns of reasoning: inference, analysis, comparison, classification, evaluation, and synthesis. Together, the six patterns of reasoning represent those most commonly found among various taxonomies, content standards documents, and assessments. They also represent the kinds of reasoning occurring most frequently in subject area curricula as well as in life beyond school.

**FIGURE 3.4** Patterns of Reasoning

**Inference:** Making a reasonable guess based on information or clues
**Analysis:** Examining the components or structure of something
**Comparison:** Describing similarities and differences between two or more items
**Classification:** Sorting things into categories based on certain characteristics
**Evaluation:** Expressing and defending an opinion, a point of view, a judgment, or a decision
**Synthesis:** Combining discrete elements to create something new

**INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE INFERENCE.** An *inference* is a reasonable guess or conclusion based on information or clues. Inferences can take one of two forms: *inductive* or *deductive* . When we make an *inductive inference* , we use evidence or facts to infer a general rule or principle. It is sometimes referred to as "reading between the lines." Sound inductive reasoning requires that we select relevant evidence or facts, interpret them accurately, and then draw careful conclusions based on them. Examples of inductive inference include the following (Klauer & Phye, 2008, pp. 86–89 ):

- Finding common attributes
- Examining information to reach a conclusion
- Making analogies
- Generalizing
- Recognizing relationships
- Building and testing a hypothesis

A *deductive inference* also involves drawing a conclusion based on information. We can make a deductive inference one of two ways. The first is to begin with a general rule or principle and then infer a specific conclusion or solution. To do it well, we apply what the general rule tells us to a specific case and draw a plausible conclusion about that specific case.

General rule: *All people get mad sometimes.*

Application to specific case: *Mom is a person* .

Conclusion *: Mom gets mad sometimes.*

A second way to make a deductive inference is to begin with a set of premises that we know to be true, and then infer a specific conclusion or solution.

Premise 1: *Boston is east of Chicago* . Premise 2: *Chicago is east of Salt Lake City* . Conclusion: *Boston is east of Salt Lake City* .

**ANALYSIS.** When we reason analytically, we examine the components or structure of something. We undertake analysis to understand something more deeply or to provide an interpretation of it. Analysis often requires that we investigate how the component parts relate to each other or how they come together to form a whole. For students to be successful, they must be able to identify the parts of something and then have practice at describing relationships among those parts, or between the part and the whole.

Examples of analysis include the following:

 • Analyzing a controversial decision, identifying the arguments for and against a particular action

- Conducting an experiment to analyze a compound to determine its component chemicals
- Determining the meaning of unknown words by breaking them into prefixes, suffixes, and root words

**COMPARISON.** Describing the similarities and differences between two or more items is at the heart of comparative reasoning. In this definition, comparative reasoning encompasses both *compare* —to find similarities, and *contrast* —to find differences. Venn diagrams and T-charts are two common graphic organizers used to help students understand the structure of comparative reasoning.

In the simplest form of comparison, students say how two things are alike or different. In its more complex form, students first select appropriate items to compare, then select salient features to base their comparison on, and last, perform the actual comparison (Marzano, Pickering, & McTighe, 1993).

The act of contrasting can also take the form of *juxtaposition* , whereby we place two significantly different things, such as objects, emotions, thoughts, melodies, colors, textures, arguments, or people, side by side to define each in sharp relief or to cause the differences between them to stand out distinctly. *Contrast* , used in this sense, is a device we manipulate for effect in areas such as writing, music, art, and drama.

**CLASSIFICATION.** *Classification* can be thought of as sorting things into categories based on certain characteristics. In its simplest form, classification consists of sorting objects into predetermined, clearly defined categories. To sort well at this basic level, students need practice at identifying and observing the pertinent characteristics that will help them determine which category the object belongs in.

A more complete exercise in classification requires students to select or create the categories and then to do the sorting. The game "Twenty Questions" is an exercise in creating categories. The first question could be, "Is it an animal?" to classify the object according to general type. The next question could be, "Is it bigger than a bread box?" to classify the object according to size. The third question might be, "Does it live around here?" to narrow the possibilities according to habitat, and so forth. The trick in Twenty Questions, as in all classification exercises, is to identify relevant categories that will provide the maximum information about the objects or concepts under consideration.

**EVALUATION.** Evaluative reasoning involves expressing and defending an opinion, a point of view, a judgment, or a decision. It can be thought of as having three facets—an assertion, criteria the assertion is based on, and evidence that supports the assertion. Students generally are able to make an assertion or judgment, but often do not follow up with the criteria or the evidence; instead, they express an opinion and then support it with further opinions. This can't be thought of as *evaluative* thinking until students are also able to identify criteria for making their assertion or judgment and are able to provide credible evidence that matches the criteria.

Content-specific examples of "assertion, criteria, and evidence" include the following:

- In mathematics problem solving, students choose a strategy by examining the options and judging the usefulness of each in the context of the problem, and then evaluate how well the strategy they selected is working as they use it.
- In science, students evaluate the validity of their conclusions based on what they know about experimental design.
- In social studies, students evaluate the quality of the arguments a politician makes against a set of criteria.

Similarly, when we ask students to evaluate the quality of their own work, they will need to use criteria describing levels of quality and then match their observations about their work to the criteria.

**SYNTHESIS.** *Synthesis* is the process of combining discrete elements to create something new. Cookies are an example of synthesis because the end product is something more than the sum of its parts—when we combine the ingredients (eggs, milk, flour, sugar, salt, and vanilla) we get something new, cookie dough, which some people bake before eating. Creating a tower out of blocks would not qualify as synthesis under this definition. Synthesizing involves selecting relevant ingredients to combine and then assembling them in such a way so as to create a new whole.

Writing a report is an act of synthesis; we want students to create something new (e.g., in their own words or with their own thoughts) from separate ingredients through a specific process. To do that they must locate and understand various bits of relevant information, sort through them, think about how they fit together, and assemble and present them in a way that does not copy any of the original sources. Sometimes we ask them to add their own thoughts as well. Although the assembly process differs according to the context, what all synthesis has in common is that it results in something different from the original ingredients.

**RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PATTERNS OF REASONING.** In line with current thought about reasoning, please note that we have not indicated a hierarchy of difficulty in the patterns of reasoning. However, some patterns of reasoning depend on other patterns to be carried out effectively. For example, before evaluating an issue, you might need to analyze it to identify the main problem, describe the different points of view on the issue, discover the assumptions that underlie various positions, and determine the information needed to inform a position on the issue; you also might need to compare positions to identify the most salient features of disagreement and agreement.

Also, the patterns are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, classifying and comparing are presented by some authors (e.g., Klauer & Phye, 2008) as types of inductive or deductive inferences because they involve either looking at the objects

to be compared to detect commonalities (induction) or using the categories to identify examples (deduction). We present inference, comparison, classification, and evaluation as separate patterns here because they are commonly referred to separately in standards documents and they can be taught and assessed separately.

**CLASSIFYING TARGETS AS REASONING.** While reasoning targets can most often be identified by the verbs they contain, many reasoning targets do not include a reasoning verb. For example, "Draws examples of quadrilaterals that do and do not belong to any of the subcategories" at first glance looks like a product target because the verb is *draws* , but the intent is clearly classification of quadrilaterals. The target, "Given a set of data or a word problem, creates an equation or inequality to solve the problem," may also look like a product target at first glance because the main verb is *creates* , but it is a reasoning target—the intent is that students are able to solve problems using equations and inequalities.

And, again, what about the verb *understands* ? Many, many standards begin with it. When *understands* means something more than *conceptual understanding* , absent further explanation it is open to a wide spectrum of interpretations. To become a clear target, a content standard that begins with the word *understands* must be accompanied by information about how that understanding will be demonstrated. Most often, the explanation includes the application of one or more patterns of reasoning. The specific pattern or patterns of reasoning to be used should be specified: teaching to this target should include instruction on how to carry out the pattern or patterns of reasoning.

Sometimes a reasoning target on paper becomes a knowledge target in practice. For example, "Compares and contrasts main characters in a novel" is a reasoning target as written. If the teacher compares and contrasts the main characters in a novel, and then tests students' ability to replicate her reasoning about the same characters, she is not testing their reasoning; she is testing *recall* of the information she shared with them. It may have started out as a reasoning target, but as measured, it has devolved to a knowledge target. Seek to avoid this in your own assessments. To test a reasoning proficiency, we must provide students with a *novel* (new) application of the specific pattern of reasoning. The key to making the determination here lies in asking, "Who is doing the reasoning?" Are the students doing something more than remembering the answers the teacher previously demonstrated?

When there is a question about target type, we recommend using this guideline, developed by Carol Commodore in her work with deconstructing standards ( personal communication, 2011):

Look at how the state is measuring the target. For example, is the target "Understands the scientific method" a knowledge target or a reasoning target? To answer this question, first, look to see how the state measures it. If that information isn't available, then go for the more advanced target, which in this case is reasoning. We are preparing our students for their future life and work, not a state test. Application is what will be required of these students in real life, so when possible, teach it as the more advanced application.

 **FAQ 3.1 Identifying Target Types**
Question

*What kinds of targets are in the following language arts standard for grade 3?* 

Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling when writing.

- **a.** Capitalize appropriate words in titles.
- **b.** Use commas in addresses.
- **c.** Use commas and quotation marks in dialogue.
- **d.** Form and use possessives.
- **e.** Use conventional spelling for high-frequency and other studied words and for adding suffixes to base words (e.g., sitting, smiled, cries, happiness).
- **f.** Use spelling patterns and generalizations (e.g., word families, position-based spellings, syllable patterns, ending rules, meaningful word parts) in writing words.
- **g.** Consult reference materials, including beginning dictionaries, as needed to check and correct spellings. (CCSSI, 2010a, p. 29 )
Answer
The standard is a series of *knowledge targets*. To double check our answer, let's test out the other possibilities.
Does the standard incorporate **reasoning targets**?

No. Confusion sometimes exists with the concept of "procedural knowledge"—in other words, if the standard stipulates that *students know how to do* something. If there is a rule to follow and the learning target represents right-or-wrong learning, chances are it is a knowledge target. But, knowing when and how to apply a rule in the case of conventions is still knowledge. It's a good example of knowledge targets not always being simple, a common bias against knowledge targets.

If, on the other hand, you have to make a judgment outside of a rule, if there are legitimate options from which to choose so that several options could be considered "right," it may represent a pattern of reasoning. For example, when we teach students to alter punctuation/conventions for rhetorical effect, we are teaching to a reasoning target. Students have to determine the effect they want to create and then experiment with conventions to create it. If the content standard doesn't call for that level of thinking, then it isn't reasoning. It doesn't mean you can't teach it, or that it's not a good thing to teach, just that the content standard, as written, doesn't ask for it.
Does the application of students' knowledge to their writing constitute a **skill**?

No. The target as stated does not specify a real-time demonstration or performance.

Couldn't it be a **product target** ?

Even though the words "when writing" are in the standard, we would not classify this standard as a product target, either, since the intent is not about the creation of some specific product itself, but rather that students apply—or as the standard says, *demonstrate*—the underlying knowledge whenever they write. Some of the components of this standard can be assessed through selected response methodology, some can be assessed through students editing text with embedded errors, and some are best assessed through students producing a sample of writing. In this last case, their writing becomes the *context* in which we assess their *knowledge.* So, even though we use a product as evidence of the learning, the learning itself is at the knowledge level.

#### **Skill Targets**

When we speak of skill targets, we are referring to those learning targets where a real-time demonstration or physical performance is at the heart of the learning. As defined, this is a somewhat narrow category. Subjects such as physical education, fine arts, performing arts, and world languages, have skill development as a central core of their discipline, and therefore have many skill targets in their curricula. Other subjects may have few or none. Examples of skill targets include oral fluency in reading, serving a volleyball, conversing in a second language, giving an oral presentation, directing scenes and productions, demonstrating movement skills in dance, and playing a musical instrument.

**CLASSIFYING TARGETS AS SKILLS.** A difficulty with the concept of *skill targets* arises from the broad use made of the word "skills": comprehension skills, research skills, writing skills, reading skills, reasoning skills, mathematics skills, science process skills, and so forth. While there is nothing wrong with calling each of those "skills," the ultimate goal of most of the underlying learning targets is some form of thinking: if you were to take each apart, you would discover a combination of knowledge and reasoning. In other instances you might discover skill targets as we have defined them here: the target as stated specifies a real-time demonstration or physical performance. This differentiation between reasoning (cognitive "skill") targets and skill targets becomes an important distinction in both teaching and assessing the learning, which will be illustrated in Chapter 4 .

Additionally, the line between procedural knowledge and skill targets blurs when the target in question is a measurement skill requiring a certain level of manual dexterity and fine motor control, such as those often encountered in science and mathematics. For the purpose of explaining how to classify targets in preparation for assessing them, we will classify these as skill targets, even though they involve, for the most part, procedural knowledge—knowing how to use the tool correctly.

#### **Product Targets**

 Some content standards specify the creation of a product. For product targets, the specifications for qualities of a good product are the focus of teaching and assessment.

 **FAQ 3.2**
Procedural Knowledge or Skill?
Question
*How do I know if a target is calling for procedural knowledge or the demonstration of a skill?* 
Answer

If a target says "The student uses measuring tools," it is a skill target. If the target says "The student knows how to use measuring tools," then some discussion needs to take place. Does this mean just having the procedural knowledge; i.e., knowing the steps? If so, it is a knowledge target. If it means that they not only have the procedural knowledge but can also use those tools, then it is a skill target.

The example that brings this home to me is the target, "The student will know how to apply CPR." The intent of this target is clearly to be able to perform CPR. I know those steps very well as I took the CPR training a couple of times—I acquired the procedural knowledge. It is a whole new thing when I have to apply that knowledge and actually perform CPR. I don't feel yet that I do that well. I might save a life, but I don't feel I have that skill mastered. Thus, I still need to work on the skill target of performing CPR.

Product examples include "creates tables, graphs, scatter plots, and box plots to display data effectively," and "creates a quality personal wellness plan." Instruction and assessment focuses on the meaning of "effectively" and "quality" in these instances. Curricula generally include far fewer product targets than knowledge and reasoning targets.

Term papers, research reports, and lab reports are product targets when the curriculum guide specifically calls for students to create them. Such product targets are not only the vehicle by which we judge knowledge and reasoning proficiencies; the creation of the products themselves represents valued learning targets and is the focus of instruction. When these products are assessed they can yield evidence of the intended learning because the creation of the product *is* the stated learning.

**CLASSIFYING TARGETS AS PRODUCTS.** Sometimes when identifying product targets, the difference between the learning target and the activity to be used to teach or assess the learning gets cloudy. For example, is "Make a desk" a product target or an activity? It could be either. What does the content standard call for? Does it call for the creation of a desk? If so, it's a product target. If making a desk is the assessment the way students will demonstrate the achievement of the learning targets—but the desk itself is not specified in the content standards, it is an activity. "Make a desk" is not generally a product target in the curriculum for a course such as Principles of Technology. Skillful use of machinery, knowing how to join pieces of wood, and how to finish surfaces *are* likely to be part of the curriculum. The task of making the desk may be the way we elicit evidence of the student's achievement of the relevant targets, but the learning target itself is not likely to be to make desks.

 *The key question in distinguishing the task or activity from the learning target is "What's the intended learning?"* 

 Teaching to learning as specified in the written curriculum rather than teaching to an activity is sometimes a difficult transition to make. Confusing the activity with the learning target can cause difficulties when classifying product targets. If the learning target doesn't call for the creation of a product, but you want to classify it as a product target, it's possible that you are including the task or activity you will use to teach the target. The ability to distinguish between the *assignment* —the task or activity students will engage in—and the *learning target* —what they are to learn by doing the work—is crucial to classifying targets and therefore to creating an accurate assessment. The key question in classifying targets is "What is the intended learning?," not "How will students demonstrate it?"

#### **Disposition Targets**

 Our last category of targets for students is one that may not be found in your written curriculum. Disposition targets reflect attitudes and feeling states, such as, "I look forward to coming to school each day," "Music is worth studying," or "I like reading." They represent important *affective* goals we hold for students as byproducts of their educational experience, and as such, are not assessed for the purpose of grading. Sometimes they are the overarching goals of schooling, often found in mission statements. The Common Core State Standards Initiative includes *productive disposition* in their summary of the Standards for Mathematics and defines it as "habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and one's own efficacy" (CCSSI, 2010c, p. 6 ).

 Dispositions in any subject are influenced by experience and we strive to develop productive dispositions through the experiences students have in our classes. Because they are nonacademic, we typically do not hold students accountable for these targets in the same way that we hold them accountable for mastery of knowledge, reasoning, skill, and product targets, but that does not mean they are unimportant or that we would never assess for them. Understanding students' dispositions provides information into who they are as learners, insights that help us work more effectively with them as individuals and as a group. If we were to find that a majority of students on a survey, for instance, clearly indicated a dislike of reading, that information might cause us to review our current reading program.

 We can think about disposition targets in terms of three characteristics (Stiggins & Chappuis, 2011). They have (1) a specific object as their focus, (2) a positive or negative

direction, and (3) varied levels of intensity, from strong to weak. When we assess them, we are looking for information about both the direction and level of intensity of feeling toward the specific focus. For example, we might offer a series of statements such as, "I am good at reading," I like reading," and "I read for enjoyment in my spare time." After each statement, students would mark one answer choice from the following options: "strongly agree," "somewhat agree," "neutral or no opinion," "somewhat disagree," or "strongly disagree." In this case, students' attitude about reading is the focus; they are asked whether they feel positively or negatively about each statement, and how strongly. Examples of disposition learning targets appear in Figure 3.8 .

 **FAQ 3.3 *Balance Among Target Types**
Question

*Should each subject's curriculum have all four types of targets in it?*

Answer

No. Target type is entirely a function of the nature of the subject. Academic subjects generally have far more knowledge and reasoning targets than skill or product targets. Reading, for example, has no product targets. Performance-based disciplines, such as music, physical education, and other performing arts, have quite a few skill targets. Product-based disciplines such as fine arts have quite a few skill and product targets. They all have knowledge and reasoning targets as well, but the balance shifts more to the skill and product levels in some subjects.

### **WE NEED GOOD CURRICULUM GUIDES**

We believe every teacher should have access to a practical curriculum guide, one that provides a clear vision of the intended learning and points the way for teaching and assessing. A good curriculum will link each year's learning targets to the previous

and following year's targets, providing continuity among grade levels. The benefits of this to students and teachers are obvious: If we know that every student has had plenty of exposure to learning how to put a capital letter at the beginning of a sentence and a punctuation mark at the end in kindergarten through grade two, it would be reasonable to expect that knowledge in grade three, and to hold students accountable for demonstrating it. If we have no clear knowledge of what previous teachers have taught, we may spend time unnecessarily addressing things that students have learned before. Or, we may expect them to come to us having learned certain important concepts, only to find that they were not in their previous teacher's plan for the year.

Additionally, a good curriculum will clearly link to whatever standards form the basis for your accountability testing (Common Core State Standards or individual state or provincial standards). It will help you answer the question, "What specifically will my students be held accountable for having learned?" A curriculum that has been aligned to state or provincial standards, coupled with a test designed to measure them, allows you to use accountability test data to identify which portions of your curriculum students do well on and which portions students do not do well on, and to adjust teaching and resources accordingly.

Articulation between grade levels and alignment with accountability measures are only part of the picture. Another crucial aspect is the amount of learning represented by your grade level or course learning targets. Does your curriculum take into account the "180-day rule?" That is, does it acknowledge how much time you have to teach? It is not possible to teach everything that is important to learn, yet many curricula still include significantly more content standards than can be taught in the given time, thus turning a blind eye to the pace of learning. This is a big problem when teachers try to incorporate formative assessment strategies: there is not time for reteaching. A good curriculum guide will define your responsibility for what to teach and will allow you to pace instruction with student needs in mind.

Lastly, we recommend that the learning targets in your curriculum be stated so that everyone who teaches a subject interprets them the same way. Is it clear to everyone what to teach from the statements in your curriculum?

### **DECONSTRUCTING COMPLEX CONTENT STANDARDS**

Even if your curriculum is comprised of clearly stated content standards, some of them may be complex. Others may require further refinement or translation in order to know exactly what to teach and assess. When you encounter a complex or unclear standard, we recommend the process of *deconstructing standards* . Often and ideally, this is work done by curriculum staff at the state or district level. But even when that is the case, engaging in the process with colleagues at the school level builds ownership for the expectations we hold in common for students, and helps ensure

agreement of the intended learning, so that everyone responsible for teaching the standard has interpreted it the same way.

During the deconstructing process, it is important to distinguish between learning targets—statements of what we want students to know and be able to do—and the manner in which we'll assess them—the tasks and assignments we'll give students to do. Remember, you are looking at what the content standard requires students to know and be able to do, not how you will assess it.

Once you have found a standard that needs deconstructing, follow these three steps.

*Deconstructing standards is the process of breaking a broad standard, goal, or benchmark into smaller, more explicit learning targets that can be used to guide daily classroom instruction.* 

#### **1. Determine the Target Type**

Is the content standard, as written, a knowledge, reasoning, skill, or product target? To determine this, consider whether the content standard's ultimate goal is the acquisition of knowledge, the development of reasoning capabilities, the demonstration of a physical skill, or the creation of a product. For Example 3.2 and For Example 3.3 show content standards deconstructed following this process.

When the standard includes several discrete learning targets, list each separately and identify the target type for each. Then proceed with steps 2 and 3 for each separate learning target. For Example 3.4 shows how you might carry out step 1 with a writing standard that is comprised of several separate learning targets. (Steps 2 and 3 are not completed in the example.)

#### **2. Identify the Prerequisite or Underlying Knowledge, Reasoning, and/or Skills**

At this step, answer the following four questions:

- What does a student need to know and understand to attain mastery of this standard?
- What patterns of reasoning, if any, are required to attain mastery of this standard?
- What skills, if any, are required for mastery of this standard?
- What products, if any, would students need to be proficient in creating to master this standard?

- **3.** Check your work for accuracy and reasonableness.

 What are the knowledge, reasoning, performance skills, and products that underpin the standard?

 **Deconstructing a Writing Standard Comprised of Several Separate Learning Targets**

Writing Standard 8, Grade 6 (CCSSI, 2010a, p. 44 )

"Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources; assess the credibility of each source; and quote or paraphrase the data and conclusions of others while avoiding plagiarism and providing basic bibliographic information for sources."

This standard has multiple learning targets stated, so the first step is to separate them and classify each component:
**TABLE-Deconstructing a Writing Standard Comprised of Several Separate Learning Targets**
| Learning Target           | Target Type & Rationale                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Gather relevant           | Evaluative reasoning: Gathering relevant information   |
| information from          | requires judging information against a standard of     |
| multiple print and        | relevancy.                                             |
| digital sources           |                                                        |
| Assess the credibility of | Evaluative reasoning: Assessing credibility requires   |
| each source               | applying criteria for credibility to each source.      |
| Quote or paraphrase       | Evaluative reasoning and synthesis: The first decision |
| the data and              | students will make is whether to quote or paraphrase;  |
| conclusions of others     | this involves making a judgment about which will       |
| while avoiding            | be more effective in the context. When students        |
| plagiarism                | paraphrase, they will be engaged in synthesis as well. |
| Provide basic             | Procedural knowledge: There are steps to follow for    |
| bibliographic             | citing sources correctly. Students will be following a |
| information for source    | learned protocol.                                      |

The second step is to deconstruct each target.

TARGET: Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources.
Knowledge:
Reasoning:

TARGET: Assess the credibility of each source.
Knowledge: 
Reasoning:

TARGET: Quote or paraphrase the data and conclusions of others while avoiding plagiarism.
Knowledge:
Reasoning:

TARGET: Provide basic bibliographic information for sources. 
Knowledge:

While engaged in this step, take the following into account:

- If a target is at the knowledge level, all underlying targets will be at the knowledge level. There will be no reasoning, skill, or product components.
- Reasoning targets will have knowledge components, but they do not require skill or product components.
- Skill targets *always* have knowledge underpinnings. They usually require reasoning as well.
- Product targets will require knowledge and reasoning, and in some cases might be underpinned by skill targets as well.

### **3. Check Your Work for Alignment and Reasonableness**

Checking for alignment means checking to be sure that all of the enabling learning targets you have listed are truly necessary to accomplish the ultimate target. Also check to be sure that you haven't included information about how you might assess it. For example, consider the standard, "Compare and contrast democracies with other forms of government," a reasoning target. It has knowledge underpinnings: knowledge of what a democracy is and knowledge of other types of government. It also has reasoning underpinnings: proficiency with comparing and contrasting. So, there are two, and only two, target types in the content standard—knowledge and reasoning. Let's say you want to assess the standard by having students create a product. You might be tempted to include learning targets relating to the product as you deconstruct the standard, *but don't* . The standard only requires knowledge and reasoning *.* As written, you can evaluate it several ways. If you do decide to have students create a product, you will want to make sure your evaluation reflects the knowledge and reasoning learning targets of the content standard and that creating the product hasn't interfered with students' ability to demonstrate mastery of the content standard.

Checking for reasonableness means paying attention to how many enabling targets you have listed. The deconstructing process always runs the risk of taking the ultimate target back to learning taught years before. This can helpful for diagnosing specific problems when students have difficulty, but it makes for a crazy-complicated curriculum if you take it too far and include all possibilities. Your deconstructed content standard then represents a multiyear curriculum, a progression spanning several years' worth of learning. When deconstructing, check to make sure you have not listed more learning targets than necessary for students *at your level* to achieve mastery of the ultimate content standard being deconstructed. If your K–12 curriculum is well thought out, the basic prerequisite knowledge from previous years will be represented in those years' content standards.

**FAQ 3.4 Deconstructing Product Targets**
Question

*If an overall standard is a product learning target, will you have all four types of targets leading up to it?* 

Answer

This is a common question. The short answer is "Sometimes, but not always."

When the answer is yes:

Let's begin with a Visual Arts product target: "Creates drawings demonstrating oneand two-point perspectives." This target will have all three target types underpinning it. Students will need to know what one- and two-point perspectives are (knowledge), they will have to plan a drawing (reasoning), and they will have to employ drawing skills to create the product.

Now consider a geometry product target: "Creates formal models of regular solids." This target rests on students' knowledge and reasoning abilities: knowing what the regular solids look like and using analysis to figure out how to make them. There are skills involved, also. Students could accomplish this by creating a pattern on paper and then cutting, folding, and pasting. However, they could also create the models on a computer by creating or selecting the appropriate shapes and then dragging and dropping them to make a template. So, there are skills involved, but in this case they are context specific.

When the answer is no:

Let's look at a cross-subject product target: "Writes arguments focused on disciplinespecific content." This target has knowledge and reasoning underpinnings such as knowing how to write a claim, identifying alternate or opposing views, evaluating sources to be used to support the claim for accuracy and credibility, and so forth. No skill targets are needed to accomplish it successfully (beyond handwriting or keyboarding, which we will assume are considered prerequisite and have already been taught).

 **My Classroom Then and Now 3.1**
**Jessica Cynkar**
What we did . . .

One of the most important things that we did to expand on our formative assessment practices was to deconstruct the state standards and indicators. Our 6th-grade English department requested two professional development days to create common definitions and understandings of the content standards and indicators. We felt that we needed to be on the same page as to "what" we were teaching, but how we got there was up to us as professionals.

We wanted the focus of this time to be very intentional and specific, so we set norms at the beginning. We wanted to make sure that we stuck to one topic at a time and the time wasn't about sharing "this is what I do in my classroom," that it was more about what we need to teach and how we get there. During this time we reviewed several sources of information: standards and indicators at our grade level (6th), standards and indicators for 5th and 7th grades, standardized testing information, and a variety of classroom resources. Together we deconstructed the indicators into their underpinning learning targets. We created common definitions and "I can" statements, added resources, and developed assessment questions. We also began to note lessons and ideas we each had for teaching each target.

How we benefited . . .

These tips have been invaluable when I've started to plan a unit or concept to teach. They have become a bag of tricks to reference, especially when students need additional support or a way to stretch their learning. Another benefit is that that it has become very clear what lessons are not working or do not fit the content that we need to teach.

### **COMMUNICATING LEARNING TARGETS TO STUDENTS**

Once our learning targets are clear to us, we need to make sure they will be clear to students ( Figure 3.10 ). If you think back to the research on the effects of assessment *for*

*Making targets clear to students helps them understand that the assignment is the* means *and the learning is the* goal*.*  learning on student achievement, you will recall that a key feature to student success is students knowing where they are going—that is, understanding what they are to learn.

Absent clear targets, students lack the information they need to self-assess, set goals, and act on the descriptive feedback they receive. Poorly defined learning expectations cause similar problems to poorly defined behavior expectations—confusion and conflict—which set students up for failure down the road.

Sharing learning targets with students can play out in several ways depending on the kind of target and its complexity. Some learning targets may be clear enough

![](_page_77_Figure_1.jpeg)

to be stated to students in their original form—"Today, we're learning how to prepare microscope slides." Other targets, while clear to you, may not be clear to students, so you may want to translate them into student-friendly terms (Chappuis, 2009). This works especially well for reasoning targets—"We're learning to summarize text. This means we're learning to make a short statement of the central ideas of what we read." For reasoning, skill, and product targets that will be assessed with a rubric, you will need to find or create a student-friendly version of the rubric, which we will address in Chapters 6 and 7 .

#### **Converting Knowledge and Reasoning Learning Targets to Student-friendly Language**

 The process for converting learning targets into student-friendly language is especially useful with patterns of reasoning. Let us say we want students to learn to summarize text. How might we explain to fourth graders what that means? Here is a process you can use (Chappuis, 2009):

- **1.** Define the word or words representing the pattern of reasoning. Use a dictionary, your textbook, your state content standards document, or other reference materials specific to your subject. If you are working with a colleague, come to agreement on definitions.
- **2.** Convert the definition into language your students are likely to understand.
- **3.** Rewrite the definition as an "I" or a "We" statement: "I am learning to _____________"; "I can _____________\_"; "We are learning to _____________"; or "We can _____________\_."
- **4.** Try the definition out with students. Note their response and refine as required.
- **5.** Let students try this process occasionally, using learning targets you think they could successfully define and paraphrase. Make sure their definition is congruent with your vision of the target.

**Student-friendly Definitions of Reasoning Learning Targets** 
**Inferring**
I can infer. This means I can make a reasonable guess based on information.
**Generalizing**
I can generalize. This means I can compare pieces of evidence to see what they have in common. Then I can make an umbrella statement that is true for them and is also true for a broader array of instances.
**Predicting**
I can predict. This means I can use what I already know (or evidence) to guess at what will happen next.
**Identifying Cause and Effect**
I can identify causes and effects. This means I can describe relationships between events by answering two questions: "What happened?" and "Why did it happen?"
**Drawing Conclusions**
I can draw conclusions. This means I can begin with a general (an "umbrella") idea or statement and identify specific situations in which it is true.
**Comparing**
I can compare and contrast. This means that I can tell how things are alike and how they are different.
**Evaluating**
I can make evaluations. This means I can identify criteria upon which to make a judgment, apply it to a specific situation, and express an opinion based on the criteria. I can also justify my opinion by using the criteria.
**Summarizing**
I can summarize. This means I can make a short statement of the big ideas or main message of what I read (hear, view, observe).
**Determining Main Idea and Supporting Details**
I can determine main ideas and identify supporting details. This means I can find important ideas in the text and point out which facts or information help to make (or contribute to) that main idea.

 **My Classroom Then and Now 3.2**
**Elizabeth Schoo**
I used to . . .
I used to teach my physical science class by following district objectives derived from state standards. These objectives were easy for me to understand and my lessons were based on these, but nowhere in my teaching was I telling my students what the goal for their learning of that day was to be. I just assumed it was obvious.
Now I . . .
Now my classroom units and lessons are all based on student-friendly "I can" statements. I have provided these statements to my students in numerous ways. In our science binders at the beginning of each chapter, I provide a sheet stating the chapter's new "I can" statements as well as any previous "I can" statements that will be reinforced. Our science team has developed a pre-assessment for the students to determine what level of knowledge they would rank themselves as having concerning the "I can" targets. Students rerank their level of knowledge at the end of the chapter and use the information to help them structure their studying for the final assessment.

To be even more student friendly, I have started to include the chapter "I can" statements on each set of notes, reinforcement worksheets, labs, quizzes, etc. that I give my students. When assessing my students at the end of a chapter, my review guide consists of revisiting these statements. I have taught my students to structure their studying based on how well they can answer the "I can" statement.
Why I changed . . .
I always told my students that there was no secret to what I was going to be teaching that day, but in reflection, by not writing student-friendly chapter targets and using them with my students, I was, in fact, keeping them in the dark.
What I notice as a result . . .
By providing my students with easy-to-understand targets for the day's lesson, they are able to focus their learning and understand the outcome for that day; they aren't left guessing what they were supposed to have learned. When surveyed to see if they liked this new format, most students responded that their study time was now more productive. They knew what to study—their time was spent more wisely on studying the statements that they lacked detail in answering rather than reviewing haphazardly everything from the chapter.

My assessments are more accurate now because I create questions that match the "I can" statements. In turn, my students see more success. The secret is out and the light is on! Simply put, changing to writing student-friendly targets and providing them with those targets has allowed me to create a classroom environment that invites students to create ownership of their learning.

### **WHEN THE WRITTEN CURRICULUM IS NOT THE TAUGHT CURRICULUM**

Your curriculum is your first assessment guide. Problems arise when the written curriculum merely sits on the shelf. Absent an easily understood curriculum guide, teachers often rely on the textbook, a list of units or activities, or a series of projects to fill its role. Let's take a look at what happens in each of these cases.

#### **Using the Textbook in Place of the Curriculum**

If we rely on the textbook to stand in as our curriculum, we may think we have solved the problem of articulation between grade levels, and perhaps alignment with state or provincial standards. However, when textbooks serve as the curriculum, we face several problems.

First, many textbooks contain too much content to teach in a year, which is in part due to how they are designed. If you are a member of a district textbook review committee (searching for a new series to purchase), you will generally look for the best match between the text's coverage and the content standards you have adopted. Textbook companies know this; they include in their products as much as could be taught in that grade level in that subject, in order to align with all potential clients' curricular objectives. (Even when texts are aligned with a particular set of content standards, it does not mean they are aligned with those standards *alone* .) Therefore, by design, most textbooks address much more content than can be successfully taught in any one class in a year. In order to include so much content, textbooks can lack in-depth treatment of many concepts. In addition, textbooks seldom provide guidance on which information is of lesser and greater importance. When we cover material, we teach at a pace that far outstrips the pace required for learning for most students; when we select what to teach independently of our colleagues, we negate the benefit for students of experiencing an articulated curriculum.

In "Seven Reasons Why a Textbook Is Not a Curriculum," Shutes and Peterson (1994) assert the following:

It is . . . time to recognize that in a curriculum vacuum, textbooks have fostered a preoccupation with content that has made content coverage an end in itself, has made didactic treatment of fact-level information the standard teaching method, and has overwhelmed learners with more information than they could possibly handle. Ironically, the teachers' strategies to cope with excess content may have alienated many of their students not only from the content but from school itself. (p. 12 )

Note that they attribute use of textbooks as the curriculum to a curriculum vacuum. What is ironic today is that very few of us are operating in a curriculum vacuum, yet textbooks' tables of contents still function as the outline of the learning for many classes. Consider these facts as reported by Schmoker and Marzano (1999):

Although U.S. mathematics textbooks attempt to address 175 percent more topics than do German textbooks and 350 percent more topics than do Japanese textbooks, both German and Japanese students significantly outperform U.S. students in mathematics. Similarly, although U.S. science textbooks attempt to cover 930 percent more topics than do German textbooks, and 433 percent more topics than do Japanese textbooks, both German and Japanese students significantly outperform U.S. students in science achievement as well (Schmidt, McKnight, & Raizen, 1996). (n.p.)

#### **Using Units, Activities, or Projects in Place of the Curriculum**

When used as our curriculum, a series of units, activities, or projects may well keep students busy and motivated. However, if activities are not consciously designed or selected with learning targets in mind, if we are not clear about the intended learning *in advance* , we may not be teaching what is most important to learn. If that is the case, we are also not adequately preparing students for the external high-stakes accountability tests they will encounter whose items are aligned to our written curriculum. And, if we do not begin with clear classroom learning targets, assessments cannot be counted on to provide accurate information about the learning.

In addition, without the unifying thread of underlying learning targets, we will not be able to build intentionally on previous learning, either from our own teaching or from the teaching in prior grades. Neither will subsequent teachers be able to build intentionally on what we have done with students. In essence, we are each in private practice, in our own teaching universe, unable to predict what our students will bring with them and unable to articulate what we send them off to the next grade with. As teachers come and go from a building, the instructional program changes course. Our scores on accountability measures are up or down, and we may have to rely on an outside program to straighten us out, imposing a "drop-in" remedial mini-curriculum. Although such practices were common when many of us were students, today none of this is in the best interest of students or teachers.

### **THE BENEFITS OF CLEAR LEARNING TARGETS**

Few educators would disagree that defining expectations for student behavior or conduct up front will head off discipline problems down the road. We can expect the same outcome when we clearly define what students are responsible for learning we solve a number of problems before they surface. With the advent of the Common Core State Standards has come a renewed focus on academic rigor and on a *clear, teachable and assessable* curriculum at the state and district levels. This has also served to spark a renewed dialogue about what constitutes a clear learning target. Most certainly, teachers need to understand curriculum documents to be able to use them. But the benefits of making sure our targets are clear extend beyond that, for teachers, students, and parents ( Figure 3.11 ).

#### **Benefits to Teachers**

**1. KNOWING WHAT TO TEACH.** First, begin with clear statements of the intended learning benefits instruction. Consider a reading curriculum that includes the content standard, "Students will comprehend fictional, informational, and task-oriented text."

**FIGURE 3.11** Benefits of Clear Targets
**To Teachers**
- **1.** Knowing what to teach
- **2.** Knowing what to assess
- **3.** Knowing what instructional activities to plan
- **4.** Avoiding "coverage" at the expense of learning
- **5.** Ability to interpret and use assessment results
- **6.** System for tracking and reporting information
- **7.** Common ground for working collaboratively with other teachers

**To Students**
- **1.** Understanding what they are responsible for learning
- **2.** Understanding and acting on feedback
- **3.** Being prepared to self-assess and set goals
- **4.** Being able to track, reflect on, and share their own progress

**To Parents**
- **1.** Helping children at home
- **2.** Understanding the grade report
- **3.** Focusing discussions at conferences

While it is clear that the ultimate goal is reading comprehension in a variety of contexts, if the curriculum does not define "comprehend" and identify the kinds of fictional, informational, and task-oriented texts students should work with that year, interpretation is left up to the individual teacher and may involve guesswork. On the other hand, if the grade level curriculum breaks "comprehend" down into a set of learning targets such as, "identifies main idea and supporting details," "summarizes text," "makes inferences and predictions," and "uses context clues to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words," individual teachers are much better prepared to know what to teach.

**2. KNOWING WHAT TO ASSESS.** One of the most important contributors to accuracy of assessment information is the match to what was or will be taught. If we are not clear about the specific learning targets at the focus of instruction, we will not be able to create or select assessments that accurately measure achievement. Before planning instructional activities, it is a good idea to have a sense of what you will assess and how.

**3. KNOWING WHAT INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES TO PLAN.** Once we know what our learning targets are and have defined how we will assess them, we are able to think clearly about what combination of instruction and learning experiences will prepare students both to learn what they need to know and to demonstrate their learning.

 **My Classroom Then and Now 3.3**
**Jeff Overbay**
**I used to . . .

Over the years I had developed a routine for teaching a new unit. All assessments would be CD-Rom generated. Students would use the textbook to define vocabulary at the end of a chapter. All activities would be a topical match for the content being taught. These activities came from the textbook materials or those I had gathered over the years of teaching. I would use the state standards and the textbook to create objectives for a unit. The textbook was what I used to drive my teaching.

Now I . . .

I have developed a new procedure for teaching a new unit. State standards are deconstructed first. Assessments are now both formative and summative. The preassessment is 10 to 12 questions in the agree–disagree format. The vocabulary and activities are congruent with the deconstructed standards. Students are given a selfassessment guide that consists of student-friendly learning targets. This guide is also generated from the deconstructed standards. These work together to help students be more involved in both the learning and assessment process.

The daily classroom procedure has also changed. At the beginning of class I place a guiding question on the board. This question is based on one of the student-friendly learning targets. Under this question I put an "I can" statement. This is something that the students must master that day or in the next few days. When appropriate I give an exitslip question to measure mastery of a concept. Quizzes are given as the unit progresses. Finally, the summative assessment is given after the content has been taught.

Why I changed . . .

There are many reasons for changing my methods of teaching. First, there never was congruency from the beginning to the end of a unit. Even though I had objectives there was never a true relationship between what was being taught and the state standards. The pre-assessment also needed to be changed. The information gathered is now useful in driving instruction. Next is that the vocabulary is now the critical vocabulary. Students are not wasting time looking up definitions. Finally, the assessment process needed to be changed. The self-assessment of learning targets is a valuable way of getting the students involved in their own learning process. Guiding questions and "I can" statements help the students stay focused from day to day. The quizzes match the targets so students know if they are succeeding as they go instead of waiting until the end of a unit. The summative assessment is now an accurate measurement of student achievement.

What I notice as a result . . .

This new format is helpful to both the students and myself. I now have a well-designed congruent "roadmap" to follow and the students have a better understanding of where they are going and how they are going to get there. As a result I have seen an increase in student achievement in the classroom and on the state assessment.

**4. AVOIDING "COVERAGE" AT THE EXPENSE OF LEARNING.** It's the beginning of May. You look at what is left to teach and the number of days left in the year and worry about how you'll get it all in. If it's world history, twentieth-century study may boil down to three quick wars. If it's math, geometry may be reduced to a few constructions, or statistics and probability to a few games of chance. If it's language arts, poetry may get the boot. A well-designed curriculum helps us avoid cramming large amounts of content into short periods of time, or "teaching by mentioning it" as Wiggins and McTighe put it (1998, p. 21 ). When your local curriculum is comprised of clear learning targets, it is easier to determine whether it is "doable," that is, "learnable" (as opposed to "coverable"), in the given time of a semester or year. The hard choices regarding what to leave in and what to take out should have been made

before a local curriculum is finalized. Only then can you reliably use it to map out the year in advance, maximizing the chances that you will get students where they need to be by the end of the year.

**5. INTERPRETING AND USING ASSESSMENT RESULTS.** When you begin with welldefined learning targets, you are able to plan assessments that reflect exactly what you will teach and what you expect students to learn. Then the results of assessments can be used to further learning, because you can disaggregate the information learning target by learning target to identify areas of growth and areas needing further work. You can also use this information to provide students with effective feedback—feedback that relates directly to the intended learning—during the learning, while there is still time to act on it. The effectiveness of data-driven decision making depends on your ability to use assessment results in these ways, which all rely on a foundation of clear targets.

**6. TRACKING AND REPORTING INFORMATION.** When you know what learning targets each assessment represents, you can track achievement by learning target or content standard, rather than by assignment title or assessment type. This approach allows you to use your records to more accurately determine what students have and have not mastered and to keep records that track achievement in ways that facilitate the completion of standards-based report cards. (See Chapter 9 for an in-depth discussion of tracking and recordkeeping options for formative and summative assessment information.)

**7. WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER TEACHERS.** One of the most powerful benefits to teachers of having agreed-on clear targets and teaching to them is the common ground it offers in working with other teachers. Schmoker (2002, p. 2 ), well before the advent of common core state standards, suggests the following:

The most enormous but peculiarly unsung benefit of common standards is that they provide the rich common context essential to focused, productive teacher collaboration, a sine qua non for improvement (Fullan 2000; Sparks 1998). Stated simply: If we want schools to improve, instruction—teaching lessons themselves —must improve (Stigler and Hiebert 1999). But there also must be a common set of standards. And there must be a commitment to reaching measurable achievement goals by making real adjustments to how we teach these common standards. There is no other way (Glickman 2002, 4–5).

#### **Benefits to Students**

**1. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEARNING.**  Explaining the intended learning to students is the crucial first step in helping them know where they are going. As Stiggins (2008, p. 1 , emphasis added) states, "Students *can* hit any target they can see that holds still for them." However, if students have no idea what they are supposed to learn, if the only information they have is that we are

doing "science" or "page 121 " or "the odd-numbered problems," few of them are likely to infer the intended learning. They are more likely to believe that the ultimate aim of their effort is to complete the assignment. The assignment, however, is the means to the end, which is the intended learning.

**2. UNDERSTANDING AND ACTING ON FEEDBACK.** Effective feedback relates directly to the learning, pointing out strengths and offering specific guidance for improvement. If students don't understand what the learning targets are, they won't be likely to understand or act on the feedback intended to help them improve.

**3. BEING PREPARED TO SELF-ASSESS AND SET GOALS.** Students cannot accurately self-assess without a clear vision of what they are aiming for. When we make targets clear to students, they have a standard to compare their current status to, making self-assessment more objective (Sadler, 1989), and information to use when setting goals for next steps.

**4. TRACKING, REFLECTING ON, AND SHARING THEIR PROGRESS.** With learning targets that are clear from the outset, students can track their own mastery of expectations by target or standard. Without a direct, visible connection to the specific learning target, grades only tell them how *well* they have learned something. Students need to see how their grades connect to the learning targets represented on each assignment and assessment in order to *connect their work and level of achievement to learning* . This helps them become clear about what they have mastered and what they still need to work on. With that information, they are able to reflect on their progress and to share their thoughts at conference time.

#### **Benefits to Parents**

**1. HELPING CHILDREN AT HOME.** Understanding what the intended learning is helps parents focus their assistance with their children. It helps them know the intent of the assignment, which guides the assistance they provide. For instance, if you are teaching students how to edit their own papers and you communicate that learning to parents, you can ask that they not do the editing for their children. If you are working on map-reading skills and assistance at home would help, you can suggest that parents have their children practice using a map to give directions on a car trip. However, if you are asking students to complete a project and parents only have the project instructions to students to go by, they will be unlikely to know what they can and shouldn't do to support the intended learning, if and when their children need help.

**2. UNDERSTANDING THE GRADE REPORT.** Additionally, being clear about the intended learning helps parents understand what grades mean in terms of what their children have and have not learned. Sending home or posting on your website a list of learning targets written in parent-friendly language can help communicate the depth

 **My Classroom Then and Now 3.4**
**Sue Cho & Aaron Mukai**
We used to . . .

We used to think we were doing great things with daily learning targets. Before beginning each chapter, we developed the learning target for each lesson in kid- friendly language. These learning targets would then be posted daily in our classrooms. In addition, we wrote these learning targets on our pre-assessments, exit tasks, and other formative assessments. We would even have our students self-assess on these learning targets at the beginning (pre-assessment), during (formative assessments), and after (summative assessments) each chapter.

Now we . . .

While we still do all of the things mentioned, we wanted to make these learning targets more meaningful to students. For starters, we revised our learning targets with quality indicators to make it clear to the students what they **should be able to do** and what they **need to do** to reach it. To do this, at the beginning of each lesson, we have the students write down the learning target with a fill in the blank option: "I can find equivalent fractions by __________________________." After we go through the lesson and before students work on the practice problems, we revisit the learning target and have the students fill in the blank: "I can find equivalent fractions by multiplying or dividing the numerator and the denominator by the same number ." The students are now able to make a connection with the learning target and the problems they are solving.

We started having our students use the learning targets to set goals for each chapter. Each pre-assessment is sectioned by the learning targets aligned with the same state standards. After a student has received their scored pre-assessment, the student is able to identify areas of improvement based on the learning target.

Lastly, we began to use a Chapter Formative Tracking Sheet. We have each student keep track of their progress on different formative assessments throughout each chapter. The students are to record three items on their tracking sheet: the name of the formative, the learning target connected to the formative, and their score on the formative. This enables students to have a better understanding of how they are doing in regards to their learning throughout the chapter. It also provides students with a clear vision the targets they still may need work.

Why we changed . . .

We changed because there seemed to be a disconnect between the learning target and with what students were learning. Looking back, we felt that if the student was able to see the learning target, they would understand the learning target. This is why we tried to post it everywhere from the classroom wall to our formative and summative assessments. The problem was the learning target lacked ownership. Our students did not seem to do anything with the learning target. We wanted to make a connection between the learning target, student learning, and the student. We also wanted our students to be able to monitor their progress toward the target better and become more invested in the learning.

What we notice as a result . . .

Learning targets have become more than just words that our students read on the board or on a piece of paper. For starters, with the quality indicators, our students are able to make a connection between the math problems they are working on with the aligned learning target. When students now read their learning target, they not only understand what the goal is but what they need to do to reach this goal.

Students also seemed to have a better understanding of their progress throughout the chapter. The goal setting using the targets at the beginning of the chapter provides a direct focus of what areas students need to improve, so that they are able to meet or exceed the learning target. The formative tracking sheet helps students get into the habit of reflecting on their own learning. Having the students actively engaged in monitoring their own progress toward learning targets helps the students understand the importance of learning targets.

and breadth of the academic work their children are engaged in. When grades come home, parents can talk specifically with their children about the learning that underpins their strengths and areas for improvement. This helps parents and students understand what is behind the grade and helps them avoid damaging generalizations, such as, "My child is not good at reading."

**3. FOCUSING DISCUSSION AT CONFERENCES.** Similarly, having a set of clear and understandable learning targets focuses the discussions during conferences on what the student is learning and how well the student is learning it. Clear targets allow you to be specific about strengths and areas needing additional attention and to give specific advice about how the parent can best help the child.

### **CONCLUDING THOUGHTS**

 A good portion of this chapter has been devoted to the assessment benefits of a quality curriculum. It is not our purpose in this book to direct curriculum development, but to make as strong a case as we can for the necessity of framing clear and specific

**FIGURE 3.12** Without Clear Targets . . .
We can't

- Know if the assessment adequately covers and samples what we taught.
- Correctly identify what students know and don't know and their level of achievement.
- Plan next steps in instruction.
- Give detailed, descriptive feedback to students.
- Have students self-assess or set goals likely to help them learn more.
- Keep track of student learning target by target or standard by standard.
- Complete a standards-based report card.

learning targets at the outset of teaching as an imperative to sound instruction and assessment ( Figure 3.12 ). We emphasize the practical necessity of each teacher understanding each learning target clearly, and the need to be in agreement with others who teach the same subjects. We also emphasize the learning gains that come from formative assessment practices require first that our learning targets be clear to students. No one benefits in the long run when the intended learning is obscure or hidden.

### **Summary**

Clear learning targets are essential for sound assessment. We can't assess accurately what is not clear. We began our exploration of clear targets by identifying five categories of learning targets, providing examples of each. Within those categories, we described a reasoning framework representing six patterns of reasoning that are commonly found in various taxonomies, content standards documents, and assessments. They also represent the kinds of reasoning occurring most frequently in subject area curricula as well as in life beyond school.

We described how to deconstruct complex content standards to make the prerequisite knowledge, reasoning, skill, and/or product targets clear. These form the scaffolding to each student's academic success. We offered suggestions for sharing learning targets with students, including ways to convert learning targets into student-friendly language so they can see the path to their success.

We gave examples of problems that arise when your curriculum or content standards are not yet clear.

Beyond this, clear targets benefit teachers, students, and parents by clarifying in the following ways what to assess and what instructional activities to plan:

- Help to avoid the problem of too much to teach and too little time.
- Provide a foundation for collaborative planning among teachers.
- Facilitate assessment for learning when students understand the intended learning they are set up for productive self-assessment and goal setting.
- Facilitate communication with parents.
