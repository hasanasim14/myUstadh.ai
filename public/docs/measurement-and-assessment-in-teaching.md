## Preface

M easurement and Assessment in Teaching, Tenth Edition, introduces the classroom teacher to those elements of measurement and assessment that are essential to good teaching. The main theme throughout the book is that the assessment of learning plays at important role in the instructional process and that its effectiveness depends heavily of the ability of teachers to construct and select tests and assessments that provide valid measures of learning outcomes.

The tenth edition is substantially revised to reflect the major changes that have occurred in educational testing and assessment since the last edition. Some of the more significant changes include:

- 1. Major revisions in Chapter 1 reflect the changing context of testing and assessment now required to meet the state and federal uses of tests for purpose. of school accountability, emphasizing in particular the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act that was signed into law by President Bush in January 2002
- 2. Many new examples of classroom assessments have been added.
- 3. Revisions in Chapter 6 have a stronger emphasis on the development of tests with higher order skills.
- 4. The discussion of motivation on standardized tests (Chapter 18) is updated.
- 5. References to many Web sites have been added or updated.
- 6. Materials on published tests reflect new editions and new approaches to assessment.

This book is designed for the introductory course in educational measurement and assessment at either the undergraduate or graduate level, and assumes no previous knowl edge of measurement or statistics. The writing is direct, and numerous examples are used to illustrate concepts and approaches to testing and assessment. Statistical concepts are introduced only where necessary for understanding and discussion, and then the empha sis is on interpretation rather than computation. A section of elementary statistics i provided in Appendix A for those who want to understand how to obtain the statistica results discussed.

Course&mart

As with earlier editions, the focus of the book is best described by a list of general learning outcomes that should result from its use.

- An understanding of the role of measurement and assessment in the instructional process
- The ability to define instructional goals and objectives in ways that facilitate the construction of appropriate tests and assessments
- An understanding of the concepts of validity and reliability and their role in the construction, selection, interpretation, and use of tests and assessments
- The ability to construct classroom tests and assessments that measure a variety of learning outcomes, from simple to complex
- The ability to obtain assessment infonnation from classroom observations, peer appraisals, and self-reports
- The ability to administer tests and assessments properly and to use their results effectively, with due regard to the necessary precautions
- The ability to interpret test and assessment results properly, with full awareness of their meaning and the ever-present eITor of measurement
- An understanding of both the potentialities and the limitations of the various test and assessment procedures used in the school
- An understanding of how tests and assessments contribute to effective marking and reporting systems and to improved instructional decisions
- The ability to interpret and use results of published tests and state assessments properly and to select ones that are most appropriate for a given purpose
- An understanding of trends and issues in the use of externally mandated tests and assessments

These understandings and abilities are most likely to be attained when reading the book is supplemented by other experiences. The Companion Website, at *http://www. prenhall.com/miller,* offers additional opportunities to review and apply chapter content and helps students explore measurement and assessment topicS using the Internet. Practical application of textbook material will enhance learning and contribute to competence in using measurement skills.

## **PART I**  *The Measurement and Assessment Process*

### **CHAPTER** 1 EDUCATIONAL TESTING AND ASSESSMENT: CONTEXT, ISSUES, AND TRENDS**

Federal and state iegislation mandate extensive use of student assessments to hold schools, districts, and educators accountable for srudent achievement. National and international assessment programs, national and state content and performance standards, and global competition have also contlibuted to increased demands for testing and assessment. The e factors have both stimulated and reflected new trends in educational measurement. On-line, computer-based testi.ng is already in lise in some places, and has expanded a good deal in the last few years. The increased reliance on resting and assessment as an educational refornl tool has also raised issue concerning the fairness of lIses and interpretations of tests and assessments. At d1e same time that externally mandated testing has been expanding, dlere also has been an increased emphasis on the LIse of formative as essments by teachers as an integral part of their day-to-day instruction.

Ectucational testing is pervasive in schools, St!l.ndarctizect paper-;,mct-pencil tests !I.re palt of federal, state, and district requirements throughout the United States. These mandated tests and assessments come in a variety of forms and are intended to serve quite a range of purposes. They include machine-scored, multiple-choice tests as well as assessments requiring short or extended answers or possibly even some types of hands-on performance assessment tasks (e.g., a science experiment or the creation of a piece of art).

Statewide testing reqUirements in selected subjects and grades have been in place in most states for a number of years. Until recently the nature of the tests and patterns of tested grades and subject areas varied substantially from state to state. Federal


legislation signed into law on JanuaIY 8, 2002, however, requires greater uniformity in state testing requirements. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act (Public Law [P.L.] 107-110) required states as of the 2005-2006 school year to test all students in grades 3 through 8 and in at least one grade in high school in reading or language arts and mathematics every year. Starting with the 2007-2008 school year, states also are required to test students annually in science in at least one grade in each of three grade spans (3- 5, 6- 9, and 10-12).

The testing required by the NCLB Act is used to hold schools, districts, and states accountable for student achievement. The law requires states to set perfonnance standards that are used to establish annual "adequate yearly progress" targets that ensure that all students will perform at the "proficient" level or above by the 2013-2014 school year. Schools that fail to meet adequate yearly progress targets 2 years in a row are placed into a "needs improvement" category. When initially identified as "needs improvement," schools must develop improvement plans, and districts must provide public school choice. When a school is identified 2 years in a row, districts are required to make available tutoring selvices for low-income students. Schools that continue to be identified for 3, 4, or 5 years in a row are subject to more severe sanctions, leading fina lly to restructuring and the replacement of teachers and school administrators.

Many states have testing and assessment requirements in addition to those mandated by the accountability provisions of the NCLB Act. The added requirements may be used for school accountability or accreditation. A substantial number of states also require students to pass tests for grade-to-grade promotion and an inaÂ·easing number of states require students to pass tests for graduation from high school.

Test and Assessment are also administered as a part of nation surveys (eg the National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP]) , and for international assessments such as the International Mathematics and Science Studies or the Progress in International Reading Literacy Studies. Indeed, the NCLB Act requires states to participate in state-bystate NAEP every other year in both reading and mathematics at grades 4 and 8. For many readers of this te).1:book, of course , another type of standardized test may come to mind as a result of the not-too-distant experience of taking the SAT or the ACT for admissions to college or taking the Graduate Record Examination for admission to graduate school.

Most students, particularly those educated in the United States, have had considerable experience with a variety of standardized tests before entering college. Standardized tests and assessments have played a prominent role in discussions of the state of education in the United States and in the educational reform initiatives. Standardized tests have also been the focus of intense controversy. Reasons for the controversies vaIY, including charges that standardized tests are biased against minorities and females and beliefs that they drive instruction in undesirable ways by an overemphasis on factual knowledge and low-level skills. Given the impoltance of standardized testing for educational policymakers and the associated issues and controversies, it is essential that teacllers understand the technology as well as the uses and abuses of standardized testing and assessment.

Although most of this book focuses on the construction and use of tests and assessments in the classroom, there are several reasons for starting with a discussion of trends and issues related to externally mandated tests and assessments. Externally mandated tests and assessments provide a context for some aspects of classroom assessment. **In** many cases, such tests and assessments are intended to be a lever of educational reform by making curriculum priorities more explidt and focusing on instructional effort. Furthermore many of the controversial issues related to standardized tests and assessments are either directly relevant to classroom assessments (e.g., questions of instructional relevance, validity, and fairness) or set the stage for considering the relative strengths and weaknesses of classroom assessments.

Although externally mandated tests receive the lion's share of attention in press coverage and dominate a great deal of political discussions about the quality of education in the United States, they represent only a relatively small fraction of aU testing and assessment that goes on in the schools. Fonnative assessments under the control of classroom teachers comprise a larger fraction of the overall testing and assessment activity in the schools. Formative assessments are frequently refelTed to as assessments *for* learning to distinguish them from externally mandated standardized tests that are referred to as assessments *of* learning. Teachers need to have a good understanding of both types of assessments.

#### **EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT: BAROMETER AN D LEVER OF REFORM**

Although students spend considerabiy more time taking teacher-made tests and assessments than they do taking tests that are externally mandated, tile latter attract the greater attention of policymakers, the media, and tile general public. Attention to eJ..'ternally mandated tests and assessments is nothing new. The United States has a long history of expecting a great deal of such tests and assessments. A 1992 report prepared for Congress by tile Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) states,

From the earliest days of the public school movement, American educators, parents, policymakers, and taxpayers have ntrned to these tests as multipurpose tools: yardstick of individual progress in classrooms, agent of school reform, filter of educational opportunity, and barometer of the national educational condition. (p. 3)

Many variations exist bOtil in the nature of the tests and assessments and in the uses that have been made of them; however, the OTA report indicates some consistent themes. Educational reformers have used results of mandated tests and assessments to document shortcomings, but, more important, they have used them as instruments of educational reform.

In the barometer role, tests and assessments are expected to provide infOlmation about current status and progress of student achievement and the quality of schooling. **In**  the role as a lever of reform, they are also expected to serve as a mechanism of refonning educational practices by clarifying priorities and motivating greater and more focused efforts on the part of students and teachers by holding educators and students accountable for results.

#### Factors That Make Tests and Assessments Appea li ng to Educatio nal Po Ii cyrna kers

- **1.** Tests and assessments are relatively inexpensive. Compared to changes that involve increases in instructional time, reduced dass size, attracting more able people to teaching, hiring teadler aides, or programmatic changes involving substantial professional development for teachers, testing is cheap.
- 2. Testing and assessment can be externally mandated. It is far easier to mandate testing and assessment

requirements at the state or district level than it is to take actions that involve change in what happens day to day inside the dassroom.

- 3. Testing and assessment changes can be rapidly implemented. Importantly, new test or assessment reqUirements can be implemented within the tenn of office of elected officials.
- 4. Results are visible. Test results routinely are reported by tlle press.

#### **FIVE DECADES OF TEST-BASED EDUCATIONAL REFORM**

Test-based reforms can readily be traced back to *tlle* middle of the 19th century, when the MassadlUsetts state superintendent of instruction used written examinations as a means of holding public schools accountable for results (Resnick, 1982). In the early part of the *20tll* century, joseph Rice (1914) administered spelling and mathematics tests to thousands of school children in a series of studies that raised questions about the efficiency of the use of instructional time. Numerous adlievement test batteries published following World War I made use of the multiple-choice tedmology that came into widespread use during the war. Although there was substantial growth in the use of tests between World Wars I and II, the expansion accelerated after World War II, particularly from the 1%Os to the present.

##### **Federal Support of Compensatory Education: Title I**

In recognition of the large disparities in educational opportunities and in student performance, considerable attention was focused on compensatory education in the mid-1960s. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 put in place the largest and most enduring of these federal effOits in this realm commonly known as Title I. Although it was reshaped in some important ways in both the 1994 and 2001 reautll0rizations (the Improving America's School Act of 1994 and the NCLB Act of 2001), Title I continues to be *tlle* largest federal program of assistance to elementary and secondary education.

The congressional demands for evaluation and accountability for the funds distributed under Title I of ESEA, as well as several other programs of the 1960s, proved to be a boon to test publishers. The testing requirements of the Title I Evaluation and Reporting System (TIERS) contributed to a substantial expansion in the use of published standardized tests. Rather than administering tests once a year in selected grades, TIERS encouraged the administration of tests in both the fall and the spring for Title I students, to evaluate the progress of students participating in the program. Although little use was made of the aggregate test results, tl1ese TIERS requirements relieved for a time the pressure from demands for accountability for this major federal program. However, dissatisfaction with the progress made in student achievement, especially for the students that Title I is intended to serve, contributed to the substantial increases in testing and accountability provisions in the NCLB Act of 2001 that were briefly described earlier.

##### **Minimum-Competency Testing**

Perceived shOitcomings of the skills of high school graduates led to tl1e rapid introduction of additional testing requirements in the 1970s and early 1980s. Minimum-competency testing (MCI) reforms swiftly spread from state to state. **In** a single decade (1973---1983), the number of states with some fonn of MCT requirement went from 2 to 34. As the name suggests, MCT programs focused on basic skills that were considered to be the minimal essentials for the next grade level or a high school diploma. Minimal basic skills, although not easy to define or defend, were widely accepted as a reasonable requirement for high school graduation. However, in a landmark case in Florida *(DebraP. v. Turlington,* 1979), the court ruled that students had to be given adequate notice of tl1e testing (2 years) and that tl1e state had to demonstrate tl1at the students had an opportunity to learn the material tested. Although several of the MCT high school graduation requirements instituted by states in the 1970s and 1980s are still in place, the recognition of the need to consider more than minin1um levels of performance soon led to other testing and assessment demands.

##### **A Nation at Risk**

Another wave of test-based reforms followed closely on the heels of the MCT movement. This round of reform effOits stressed school-level accountability and attempted to push beyond minimums. The test-based refonns of the middle and late 1980s were encouraged by a number of reports on the status of education that were completed in 1983. *A Nation at Risk: The Imperative jar Edu.cational Reform,* issued by the National Commission on Excellence in Education (1983), was probably the best known and most influential of these. That report featured tests in two ways: (1) to document shortcomings in student achievement, and (2) as a recommended mecl1anism of refonn.

All 50 states introduced some type of educational refonn in the wake of *A Nation at Risk* Consistent with the emphasis of the repOlt, testing was central in the majority of statelegislated reform efforts. Indeed, in many cases, externally mandated tests were relied on as the major instrument of reform. Many of the reforms involved an expansion of the use of test results for accountability purposes. Accountability programs took a variety of forms but shared the common characteristic tl1at tl1ey increased real or perceived stakes of results for teachers and educational administrators.

Building and district "report cards" shOWing student test perfonnance were used to make educators more accountable for student achievement. As intended, test-based comparisons of schools and districts placed considerable pressure on scl1001 superintendents, principals, and teachers to "get the scores up." Test preparation became a major

Conclusion of Inadequate Achievement

The educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a people. (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983, p. 5)

Reliance on Tests as a Mechanism of Reform

A Nation at Risk recommended the use of tests as instmments to improve education through their use to

(a) certify the student's credentials; (b) identify the need for remedial intervention; and (c) identify the opportunity for advanced work. (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983, p. 28)

component in the instructional programs of many ScllOOls. Teachers reported in surveys that, as the result of the pressure, they focused their instruction on the skills tested, taught test-taking skills, and used the format of the eX1emally mandated test in their own tests. The focus sometimes nalTowed to the specific topics known to be on the mandated test, and practice was provided on items similar to those in the test. Under high-stakes testing conditions, topics corresponding to important instmctional objectives not included on the test often were found to fall by the wayside as the testing date approached (see, for exampie, Noian, Haiadyna, & Hass, 1992; Shepard, 2000; Smith & Rottenberg, 1991).

Although some states and districts contracted for or developed their own tests, the accountability systems of the 1980s relied heavily on published standardized tests. Upward trends in student adlievement were reported by an overwhelming majority of states and districts during the first few years of accountability testing programs. A phYSician, John Cannell (1987), forcefully brought to public attention what came to be known as the "Lake Wobegon effect," that is, the incredible fmding that essentially all states and most districts were reporting that their students were scoring above the national norm. The Lake Wobegon effect received considerable publicity. This finding that almost all states using standardized tests in the elementary grades were reporting that the majority of their students were above the national average has generally been attributed to a combination of placing great pressure on getting scores up and the reuse of the same test with old norms year after year (linn, Graue, & Sanders, 1990). The Lake Wobegon effect raised serious questions about the credibility of test results and about the possible negative side effects of high-stakes accountability uses of standardized test results.

##### **Standards-Based Reform**

The wave of reform in dle 1990s continued to emphasize accountability but added some Significant new features. Perhaps the four most notable of the new features are the emphasis on (a) adopting ambitious, "world-class" standards that bodl shape dle assessments and define levels of acceptable performance; (b) using forms of assessment that reqUire students to perform more substantial tasks (e.g., construct extended essay responses and

conduct experiments) rather than only select answers on multiple-choice items; (c) the attad1ment of high-stakes accountability mechanisms for schools, teaci1ers, and sometimes students; and (d) the inclusion of all students.

Content and Pe rformance Standards. Educational improvement must begin with a clear idea of what students are expected to learn. This premise underlies the standards-based efforts to improve American education. Standards are statements that specify what should be taught and what students should learn. Standards specify goals or expectations for students, but they do not mandate a particular curriculum, textbook, or instructional approach. There may be many ways of achieving the ends identified in the standards. The key to effective standards, however, is that they be specific enough to identify what students need to learn and to determine when the standards have been met.

These two purposes--identifying what students need to learn and determining when the standards are achieved by students---correspond to the two types of standards that are commonly distinguished: content standards and pelformance standards. Content standards specify the "what," whereas performance standards specify "how weU. " That is, content standards are public statements that specify what students should know and be able to do in specific content or subject-matter areas at identified points of their education (e.g., grade 4 reading or grade 8 mathematics). Performance standards are dependent on content standards but add the specification of the level of performance that students are expected to achieve in relationship to the content standards. In other words, they answer the question, How good is good enough? Ideally, "they indicate both the nature of the evidence ( such as an essay, mathematical proof, scientific experiment, projet,exam or combination of these) required to demonstrate that content standards have been met and the qUality of student performance that will be deemed acceptable (what merits a passing or an 'A' grade)" (National Educational Goals Panel, 1991, p. 22).

We will have more to say about standards in Chapter 3. For present purposes, however, it is sufficient to note that with encouragement from content-specific teachers' associations (e.g., the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National Council of Teachers of English) and the federal government through the Goals 2()()O legislation, almost evelY state developed and adopted some form of content standards duting the 1990s. In many states, the content standards have served as the basis for developing assessments that are intended to be "aligned" with the standards.

Content Standards On-Line
Content standards developed by states and national professional associations may be found on the World Wide Web. A good place to start is:

links to other sites organized by content area and state may be found there.

http://WWW.moÂ·el.orglstandards-benchmalks.

Performance-Based Assessment. Coinciding with and reinforced by the movement to develop content and pelformance standards was the substantial press throughout the 1990s for the development and use of "new" approaches to assessment, variously referred to as alternative assessment, authentic assessment, direct assessment, or performancebased assessment. Each qualifier stresses a different aspect of the assessments: *authentic*  sU"esses an emphasis on "real-world" tasks relevant outside the classroom, *alternative*  stresses something other than the familiar multiple-c11Oice test, and *performance* stresses the actual doing of a task (e.g. , writing an essay or doing a hands-on experiment) rather than merely recognizing or knowing a right answer. Whatever the qualifier, *assessment* is intended to suggest a shift from ftxed-response, machine-scored tests to the use of tasks requiring students to construct responses.

Calls for the increased reliance on perfonnance-based assessment generally rest on three premises that were articulated by Resnick and Resnick (1992). The first premise is characterized by the acronym WYTIWYG (What You Test Is What You Get). The second premise is the converse of this: "You do not get what you do not assess." The third premise is a logical conclusion that follows from acceptance of the first two: "Make assessments worth teaching to" (Resnick & Resnick, 1992, p. 59).

These premises are coupled with an acceptance of the argument that high-stakes testing and assessment shapes instruction and student learning. Rather than trying to dlange that connection, proponents of performance-based assessment argue that it is assessments that need to be modified not only to eliminate the negative effects of teaching to the assessment but also to make that activity have the desired result of enhanced student learning.

ments, although not new, has become increasingly popular with policymakers in states and districts throughout the country. The high-stakes accountability provisions of the NCLB Act of 2001 differ from the past in that they come from the federal level and now apply to all states, but are in keeping with the trend toward ratcheting up the stakes attacl1ed to test results for scl100ls apparent in many states for most of the *1990s.* More often than not, the stakes have applied primarily to educators by using the results of tests to determine rewards and sanctions for scl100ls. For example, some programs identified schools that received not only special recognition but also monetalY rewards for improved perfolmance of students on the mandated state or district assessments. In some instances, those monetary rewards could be shared by teachers in the school. For schools where performance on assessments did not improve or even declined, various types of sanctions have been imposed by states. Examples of sanctions imposed through assessment-based accountability systems include bringing in an external team to oversee the school, reassigning teachers to other schools, and removing principals. Under the provisions of the NCLB Act, tutoring, expanded time for instruction either after scl1001 or during the summer, and public school choice may be provided to students in low-performing schools. Schools where students score below established target levels may be restructured and teachers and administrators may be replaced.

The stakes for individual students have also been increased in a number of states in recent years. Because of phase-in schedules, the requirements for su.ldents that may affect high school graduation, the type of diploma a student receives, or grade-to-grade promotion have not been fully implemented in all cases, but the movement toward increased requirements is widespread. Tougher grade-ta-grade promotion and graduation requirements appear at first blush like a replay of the minimum-competency testing movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s. They differ, however, in that the new requirements that are envisioned are intended to set more ambitious "world-class" performance standards.

Inclusion of All Students. A prominent feature of standards-based educational efforts is the emphasis on high expectations for *all* students. Past practices of excluding a relatively large percentage of students from state and district standardized test programs because of limited English proficiency, because they recently moved to a state or district, or because of student disabilities are incompatible witll the push to include all students. The goal of including all students in the assessment requires the use of multiple strategies. First, many students who would have been excluded in the past can in fact palticipate in assessments without any special considerations or adaptations of procedures. For tll0se students, only a commitment to include is needed rather than allowing students to be excluded when convenient. Inclusion is a prominent part of the requirements of the NCLB Act. Schools that test less than 95% of their eligible students will be placed in tile needs-improvement categOlY regardless of how well the students who are tested perform on tile tests.

Many students who would likely have been excluded in the past can be included with minor accommodations of the assessment. Some accommodations, such as extended time to complete the assessment, are ones that may lead to changes in assessment conditions that improve the validity of the assessment for all students. For example, when speed is not tile issue, untimed assessments or ones with generolls time limits may increase validity and fairness for all students and at the same time reduce the need to offer extended time to complete the assessment for some students

More extensive modifications are clearly needed for some students to meaningfully participate in the assessment. English-language learners who are proficient in anotller language, for example, may have knowledge and skills in a content area other tllan reading or writing in English that can be assessed in the student's first language but cannot be reasonably assessed in English.

Accommodations are also needed for some students with disabilities. The nature and extent of accommodation needed clearly depends on the kind and severity of a student's disability. Large-print and Braille versions of an assessment are obvious adaptations for students with visual impairments. Students with some types of physical handicaps may require someone to record tlleir responses for them. However, by far the largest fraction of students who were excluded from assessments in the past because of disabilities that require individual education plans (IEPs) are students with learning disabilities.

Many students with IEPs for learning disabilities are likely to be able to take parts or all of standards-based assessments without special accommodations. No single type of accommodation will be appropriate for all tllOse students with learning disabilities that reqUire some kind of accommodation. Rather, several different approaches are likely to be needed. Among the more common suggested accommodations for students with learning disabilities are shorter assessments, more time for completing assessment tasks, oral reading of directions, assessment in small groups or individually, and oral responses to tasks.

Classroom teacilers face issues of making appropriate accommodations in both their instruction and classroom assessment in working with students with IEPs. Altll0ugh the IEP is the essential source for gUiding the decisions that teachers must make in theseregards, it is clear that considerable professional judgment on the part of teachers is also required. The guiding principle for accommodations on an assessment, whether it is extemally mandated or one developed by the teacher for classroom use, is that the accommodations be comparable to the ones required by the student's IEP for instruction.

##### **No Child left Behind**

The fifth consecutive decade of test-based educational refonn was ushered in by the NeLB Act of 2001. Although this act is a reauthorization of the ESEA of 1965, its extensive testing requirements apply to all public schools, not just to those receiving Title I funds. The NCLB Act reinforces the role of content and performance standards. Specifically, the law requires each state to "demonstrate that the State has adopted cl1allenging content standards and challenging student performance standards that will be used by the State" (P.L. 107-110, Section 1111[b) [1) [AJ).

As noted previously, almost every state had adopted content standards, and most states had some tests in place for selected grades and subjects that were intended to measure their content standards. Most states had set performance standards on their tests. There is great variability among the states, however, in the breadth, depth, and specificity of their content standards. There is also considerable variability in the stringency of the performance standards that have been set by states (for a discussion of variability in state performance standards, *see* Linn, 2003). To satisfy the requirements of the NCLB Act, however, states were requited to submit plans justifying the claim that their content standards are challenging and that they have in place challenging performance standards, refenÂ·ed to in the law as student academic achievement standards. The student academic achievement standards must be "aligned with the State's academic content standards ... describe two levels of high achievement (proficient and advanced) that determine how well cl1ildren are mastering the State academic content standards; and desO"ibe a third level of achievement (basic) to provide complete information about the progress of lower-achieving children toward mastering the proficient and advanced levels of achievement" (p.L. 107-110, Section 1111[b) [1) [D) [ii)).

The performance standards set by states for use under the provisions of the NCLB Act are of consequence because they are used to set intennediate annual achievement targets for student achievement sucl1 that all students will be at the "profident" level or higher by the 2013-2014 school year. The end goal of 1()()O/o proficient in 2014, together with

In addition to the u.S. Department of Education's NCLB Web site (http://www. nclb.gov), most state Web sites include links to information about the NCLB Act as well as specific information about the way in which the state has met the requirements of the law.

##### **The Question of Impact**

The degree to which the increased pressure helped or hun education is controversial. Proponents of high-stakes testing argue that the tests measure objectives that are important for students to learn and that it is desirable for teadlers to focus their attention on those objectives. They point with pride to the increases in test scores that were observed in state and distlict testing programs since the 1990s.

Critics of the increased emphasis on test results argue that an ovelTeliance on test results distorts education. They argue that inlportant objectives are ignored when they are not included on the tests that count. Moreover, they claim that the increased scores paint a misleading picture because teachers teach the specifics of the tests rather than more general content domains (Koretz, 2005).

The proper role of externally mandated tests and assessments in directing instruction is an issue with which you will struggle, especially if the current emphasis on holding educators accountable for results on these instlUments continues. What sort of preparation for taking tests or assessments should students have? How much time should be spent in test preparation activities, such as taking practice tests and learning test-taking strategies? To what degree should tested objectives be given emphasis at the expense of objectives that are not tested? These are important educational questions that have no simple answers. They reqUire thought and reflection on the part of individual teachers and principals.

ConSider, for example, the seemingly simple issues of "teaching to the test" and "teaching the test itself." We are almost always interested in making inferences that go beyond the specific test that is used. We would like, for example, to be able to say something about the degree of a student's understanding of mathematical concepts based on the score that is obtained on a math concepts test. Because the items on a test only sample the domain of interest, the test score and the inference about the degree of understanding are not the same. A generaliZation is required, and it is the generalization, not the test score per se, that is important. When the specific items on the test are taught, the validity of the inference about the student's level of achievement is threatened. Teaclling the spedfic test items is apt to result in an exaggerated view of student adlievement in the overall domain of interest.

Teaching to the test-that is, emphasiZing the objectives that are on the test without teaching the specific test items--has both advantages and disadvantages. Many schoois and districts have made teaching to the test more systematic by the introduction of "benchmark" tests. These are tests that are sinlilar to and keyed to the same content standards as the state mandated test, but are administered several times during the year prior to the adnlinistration of the state test. The benchmark test results are used to identify students who are likely to have difficulty on the state test, and teachers are expected to devote special attention to those students to help them perfonn at the proficient level or above on the state test. Inasmuch as the objectives on the test are important, emphasizing those objectives with or without the use of benchmark tests provides a desirable focus. On the other hand, multiple-choice,

standardized tests do not cover all the important learning objectives. Hence, narrowing to only those objectives that are covered would be detrimental for education as a whole.

#### TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN TESTING AND ASSESSMENT

With the rapid growth in the availability and power of relatively low-cost microcomputers, it is not surprising that the use of computers to administer tests is becoming increasingly common. Indeed, some readers of this text may have taken or be planning to take the computer-administered Graduate Record Examination, the Academic Skills Assessments of the Praxis Series: Professional Assessments for Beginning Teachers, or one of the other computer-based tests offered by the Educational Testing Service. A special issue of Education Week titled "Pencils Down: Technology's Answer to Testing," published in May 2003, was devoted to the use of computer technology to administer and score tests. The editors' introduction to the special issue argues that there has been a convergence of education and technology that has vaulted "computer-based testing into the headlines, raising important questions about whether this new mode of assessment is more useful than traditional paper-and-pencil exams" (The Editors, Education Week, May 8, 2003, p. 8). The editors note that the NCLB Act has created a new stimulus for schools to find more efficient ways of testing with faster turnaround than is possible with paper-and-pencil testing technology. According to Education Week, 12 states and the District of Columbia had already launched some form of computer-based testing or pilot program when the special issue appeared. The use of computer-based testing has continued to grow since the pub-Collication of the 2003 special issue of Education Week. During the 3 years from May 2003 to May 2006, the number of states with some form of computer-based assessment of students increased from 12 to 22 (Swanson, 2006, p. 55).

Using a computer to administer items from a paper-and-pencil test can have several advantages. Rather than waiting several weeks to receive test results, scores can be obtained immediately. Computer-based testing also provides the means of tailoring the test to individual students by using performance on previously administered items to select the next item to administer. Although the start-up cost can be substantial, on-line, computerbased testing can also result in substantial reductions in printing, distribution, and scoring expenses. The catch, however, is the need to have more computers available for use in the schools than are currently available in many schools. Judging from a recent special issue of Education Week on technology in the schools, which indicated that the national average was 3.8 students per instructional computer (Swanson, 2006. p. 51), it is reasonable to believe that the typical school now has enough computers to make it feasible to administer computer-based tests.

Computers to administer tests that count is one use and, in the short term, may not be the most common use of computer-based testing. There is an almost insatiable demand for the use of practice tests and other forms of test preparation. The flexibility and immediate score reporting offered by on-line testing makes the technology especially appealing for purposes of test preparation. As discussed in later chapters, computer-based testing also has substantial potential for teachers for their own classroom assessments.

**Illustrative On-Line and Aclaptive Testing Software**

http://mgb3.quizlab.com/secured/newteacher.cfm http://www.fscreations.com/ http://www.onlinetesting.net/ http://www.exambuilder.com/

One change that has already been widely implemented is the use of the computer to administer adaptive tests, that is, tests in which the choice of the next item to administer is based on previous responses of the test taker. Adaptive tests can enhance both the efficiency with which information is handled and the quality of that information. The design of an adaptive test usually starts with the administration of an item that is expected to be of middle difficulty. The second and subsequent items to be administered are determined by the responses of the test taker. In general, if a test taker answers an item correctly, then the computer will select a somewhat more difficult item to administer next. Conversely, a somewhat easier item is administered following an incorrect response. Testing is stopped when the estimates of the individual's performance reach some predetermined level of precision or when some pragmatic maximum number of items has been administered. A variety of computer software is available for administering tests (see the box "Illustrative On-Line and Adaptive Testing Software").

It has been demonstrated that adaptive testing can enhance the efficiency and the precision with which certain types of knowledge, skills, and abilities are measured. In some cases, adaptive tests can obtain the same level of reliability of measurement in just over half the time required for a conventional paper-and-pencil test. If adaptive tests only administer items of the type already in use in a better way, however, the full potential of the use of computers for the administration of tests will not be realized. The attraction of computers as testing devices is not limited to doing better what we already do. Their potential to measure proficiencies that are not measured well by conventional paper-andpencil tests is even more appealing.

In the long run, the potentially more significant changes in testing as the result of computer-based testing depend on using the computer to do things that cannot be reasonably accomplished with paper-and-pencil tests. The technology opens the door to the use of video simulations or problem settings where students access information from the Web or a CD in ways similar to instructional use of that technology.

Simulations can be used to present test takers with problems that have greater realism and more apparent relevance than problems that are commonly found on paper-andpencil tests. Computer-based examinations that have been used for some time in medical education and in certification testing for physicians provide an illustration of the type of simulation tests that are apt to be seen in the future as computerized test administration becomes more common. Computer problems simulate aspects of the job of a physician. The test taker is initially presented with a limited set of information about a patient, such as a verbal description of symptoms of the type that a patient might provide at the start of C CourseSmart

a visit. The test taker then has a variety of options, such as getting a patient history, ordering laboratory tests, or deciding on a course of treatment. Requested information is provided, and new options can be followed by the test taker until a diagnosis is made and a course of treatment prescribed.

Computer-administered problem simulations along these lines have potential advantages over current paper-and-pencil tests in many content areas. They provide a means of going beyond the sort of factual recall that is sometimes overemphasized on paper-andpencil tests. They focus attention on the use of information to solve realistic problems. They can help assess not only the product of a student's thinking but also the process that the student uses to solve a problem, including the way in which the problem is attacked, the efficiency of the solution, and the number of hints that may be needed to solve the problem.

#### PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT TESTING AND ASSESSMENT

Decisions about the selection, administration, and use of educational tests and assessments are no longer left to the educator alone. The public has become an active and vocal partner. As discussed previously, externally mandated testing has been imposed on the schools by states or districts as a result of the public demand for evidence of the school programs' effectiveness. In some states, the public at large has participated, through selected groups, in determining the objectives and standards of the statewide assessment programs. In states where testing and assessment has been made the responsibility of the local school district, parent groups often help shape the programs. It is interesting to note that the concern of state legislators and the general public with the quality of school programs has created a demand for more testing and assessment in the schools, not less.

During the expansion of testing programs, the concern has been that there may be too much testing in the schools. In addition to taking the tests in the local school program, high school students, for example, may also have to take one or more state competency tests and several college admissions tests. It is feared that the heavy demand on their time and energy might detract from their schoolwork and that the external testing programs may cause undesirable shifts in the school's curriculum. When teachers and schools are judged by how well students perform on state tests and assessments and by how many students are accepted by leading colleges, direct preparation for the tests and assessments is likely to enter into classroom activities and thereby distort the curriculum.

Probably the greatest public concern has been with the social consequences of testing, especially perceived threats to the rights and opportunities of individuals and groups. This concern has shown up in the form of attacks on standardized tests and the testing industry, new legislation affecting testing, calls for a moratorium on standardized testing, and charges that tests are biased and discriminatory. There are certainly some good reasons for the public's concern with the social consequences of testing. It is important, however, to distinguish between negative consequences for individuals or groups that are due to faults in the tests or assessments and ones that are caused by the misinterpretation and misuse of test scores.

Discussed next are four areas of concern resulting in controversy over testing and assessment: (1) the nature and quality of tests, (2) the effects of testing on students, (3) fairness to minorities, and (4) gender fairness. Some of these issues, particularly the effects of testing and questions of fairness and bias, are also considered in subsequent chapters, in part because they are fundamental issues for all testing and assessment and in pan because they can be dealt with more adequately after developing some fundamental concepts of testing and assessment, such as validity (see Chapter 4).

##### Nature and Quality of Tests

A long-standing criticism of standardized tests is directed primarily at the use of multiplechoice items. In the early 1960s, critics such as Hoffman (1962) contended that the multiplechoice item penalized the more intelligent original thinkers. He supported his claims by reviewing items from standardized tests and showing how some highly able and creative students were likely to see implications in the items not thought of by the test authorCs) and thus question the correctness of the keyed answers. Although Hoffman obviously was able to discover some defective items that appeared in standardized tests, his criticisms seemed to go well beyond the evidence presented. He did, however, encourage test publishers to supplement statistical item analysis with a more careful, logical analysis of test items.

Multiple-cl10ice questions continue to bear the blunt of criticisms made by both specialists in educational measurement who seek ways of improving educational tests and critics who would like to eliminate standardized testing. For example, Frederiksen (1984), a major contributor to the field of measurement, has argued that multiple-choice items place too much emphasis on ''well structured problems" when problems of greatest interest both in and out of school are often "ill structured" and where skills such as problem identification and hypothesis generation are often as important as problem solution. Such criticims have lead to increased emphasis on open ended questions and the design of computer simulation tests.

Another type of cliticism--that tests *measure only limited aspects* of an individualhas also received considerable attention. This criticism is well founded. Tests do measure specific and limited samples of behavior. Aptitude tests typically measure samples of verbal and quantitative skills useful in predicting school Sllccess, and achievement tests measure samples of student performance on palticular learning tasks useful in assessing educational progress. Both fulfill their limited functions well , but the difficulty arises when we expect more of them than was intended. For example, both the advocates and the critics of college admissions testing sometimes assume that the tests measure all that is needed for success in college and beyond. This tendency to read into test scores more than they really tell has been called the "whole person fallacy" by W. W. TIU n bull , the former president of the Educational Testing Service.

**Tests Measure On Iy a Narrmv Segment of Ski lis and Abilities**

Ability and academic achievement occupy an Olympian perch on the prestige ladder. Yet it is widely agreed that motivation, creativity, personal honesty, intuition, even the degree of social consciousness play Significant roles

in the struggle for the most cherished of Amelican ideals--"success in life." Admission tests thus measure a relatively nalTOW segment of the human potential. (Educational Testing Service, 1979, p. 6)

Much of the misinterpretation and misuse of test scores could be avoided if the limited nature of the information tests provide was more widely recognized. In college admission decisions, as well as in all other educational decisions, test scores provide just one type of information and always should be supplemented by past records of achievement and other types of assessment data. No major educational decision should ever be based on test scores alone.

To help avoid an overreliance on test scores, it is important to recognize that all assessments are subject to error and that predictions in all areas are fallible. Recognizing the limitations of tests and assessments is a critical component of the proper use of results. To put the limitations in context, it is also impoltant to compare the tests' reliability, validity, and fairness with the alternatives. Would our judgments of aptitude and achievement be more trustworthy and fair without test results? Would our predictions of future school or occupational success be more valid without the additional information supplied by tests? Would our educational decisions be improved if we stopped using tests? Qualified users of tests take into account the possible error in test scores during interpretation and use, and they combine test scores with other relevant information when making educational decisions. To argue that better educational decisions would be made without test scores is to argue that better decisions are made when less information is available. Test scores are certainly fallible, but probably less so than most of the other types of information that enter into educational decisions. See the box "What Are the Consequences of Not Testing?"

##### **Effects of Testing on Students**

Critics of testing argue that testing is likely to have certain undesirable effects on students. Some of the most commonly mentioned charges directed toward the use of aptitude and achievement tests are listed here with brief comments.

Criticism 1: Tests Create Anxiety. There is no doubt that anxiety increases during testing. For most students, it motivates them to perform better. For a few, test anxiety may be so great that it interferes with test perfonnance. These typically are sUldents who are generally anxious, and the test simply adds to their already high level of anxiety. A number of steps can be taken to reduce test anxiety, such as thoroughly preparing for the test, taking practice exercises, and using liberal time limits. Fortunately, many test publishers in recent years have provided practice tests and shifted from speed tests to power tests. This should help, but it is still necessary to observe students carefully during testing and to discount the scores of overly anxious students.

Criticism 2: Tests Categorize and Label Students. Categorizing and labeling individuals can be a serious problem, particularly when those labels are used as an excuse for poor student achievement rather than a means of proViding the extra services and help to ensure better acllievement. It is all too easy to place individuals in pigeonholes and apply labels that determine, at least in part, how they are viewed and treated. Classifying students in tenns of levels of mental ability has probably caused the greatest concern in education. When students are classified as mentally retarded , for example, it influences how teachers and peers view them, how they view themselves, and the kind of school

**What Are the Consequences of Not Testing?**

If the use of educational tests were abandoned, the encouragement and reward of individualized efforts to learn would be more difficult. Excellence in programs of education would become less tangible as a goal and less demonstrable as an attainment. Educational opportunities would be extended less on the basis of aptitude and merit and more on the basis of ancestry and influence; social-class barriers would become less permeable.

Decisions on important issues of curriculum and method would be made less on the basis of solid evidence and more on the basis of prejudice or caprice. These, it seems to us, are likely to be the more harmful consequences, by far. Let us not forgo the wise use of good tests.

programs they receive. When students are mislabeled as mentally retarded, as has been the case with some racial and ethnic minorities, the problem is compounded. At least some of the support for mainstreaming handicapped students has come from the desire to avoid the categorizing and labeling that accompanies special education classes.

Classifying students into various types of learning groups can more efficiently use the teacher's time and the school's resources. However, when grouping, teachers must take into account that tests measure only a limited sample of a student's abilities and that students are continuously changing and developing. By keeping the groupings tentative and flexible and regrouping for different subjects (e.g., reading and math), teachers can avoid most of the undesirable features of grouping. It is when the categories are viewed as rigid and permanent that labeling becomes a serious problem. In such cases, it is not the test that should be blamed but the user of the test.

Criticism 3: Tests Damage Students' Self-Concepts. This is a concern that requires the attention of teachers, counselors, and other users of tests. The improper use of tests may indeed contribute to distorted self-concepts. The stereotyping of students is one misuse of tests that is likely to have an undesirable influence on a student's self-concept. Another is the inadequate interpretation of test scores that may cause students to make unwarranted generalizations from the results. It is certainly discouraging to receive low scores on tests, and it is easy to see how students might develop a general sense of failure unless the results are properly interpreted. Low-scoring students need to be made aware that aptitude and achievement tests are limited measures and that the results can change. In addition, the possibility of overgeneralizing from low test scores will be lessened if the student's positive accomplishments and characteristics are mentioned during the interpretation. When properly interpreted and used, tests can help students develop a realistic understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and thereby contribute to improved learning and a positive self-image.

Criticism 4: Tests Create Self-Fulfilling Prophecies. This criticism has been directed primarily toward intelligence or scholastic aptitude tests. The argument is that test scores

create teacher expectations concerning the achievement of individual students; the teacher then teaches in accordance with those expectations, and the students respond by achieving to their expected level-a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus, those who are expected to achieve more do achieve more, and those who are expected to achieve less do achieve less. This so-called Pygmalion effect received strong support from a widely heralded study by Rosenthal and Jacobsen (1968), even though the study was later challenged by other researchers (Elashoff & Snow, 1971; West & Anderson, 1976). The belief that teacher expectations enhance or hinder a student's achievement is widely held, and the role of testing in creating these expectations is certainly worthy of further research.

In summary, there is some merit in the various criticisms concerning the possible undesirable effects of tests on students; but more often than not, these criticisms should be directed at the users of the tests rather than the tests themselves. The same persons who misuse test results are likely to misuse alternative types of information that are even less accurate and objective. Thus, the solution is not to stop using tests but to start using tests and other data sources of information more effectively. When tests are used in a positive manner-that is, to help students improve their learning and development-the consequences are likely to be desirable rather than undesirable.

##### Fairness of Tests to Minorities

The issue of test fairness to racial and ethnic minorities is a critical issue for any assessment program. Fairness has received increasing attention over the years in the literature on testing and assessment. Concern with the fairness of tests has paralleled the general public concern with providing equal rights and opportunities to all U.S. citizens. An analysis of the discussions of fairness in testing and assessment makes it evident that the concept of fairness is used in many different ways. Testing and assessment professionals have often equated fairness with an absence of bias-considering, for example, a test use as fair if predictions of nontest performance are comparable for different racial or ethnic groups.

Fairness may also focus on the equity in treatment of persons from different groups in the assessment process. This second notion of fairness is sometimes referred to as procedural fairness and involves questions such as the following: Do test takers have an equal opportunity to show what they know and can do on a test? Are responses to essay questions graded comparably by raters without regard to the test taker's group membership?

A third meaning of fairness would require that students be provided with an adequate or equal opportunity to learn the material that is assessed. A fourth meaning of fairness that is common in some popular uses of the term is the equality of results. From this perspective, a test would be considered fair only if the average performance of different groups (e.g., African Americans, Latinos, and whites) was the same.

These four conceptions of fairness-absence of bias, procedural fairness, opportunity to learn, and equality of results-are consistent with the discussion of the topic in the latest revision of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999). The different perspectives can lead to quite different conclusions about the fairness of any test or assessment. The fourth conception, equality of results, is incompatible with other tenets of testing and assessment, such as the goal of getting a valid and reliable measure of what students know and can do regardless of their background or group membership. Inasmuch as different groups of students differ in the instruction they have received, their experiences both in and out of school, and their interest and effOlt, one cannot expect a valid measure to show no difference between the groups. In other words a test or assessment that shows average differences in scores for minority and majority group students may fairly reflect the consequences of unfair treatment of minorities by the SOCiety.

An absence of bias and procedural fairness is essential for an assessment to have a high level of validity in measuring the knowledge, skills, and understandings that it is intended to measure. In other words, those characteristics are essential to avoid unfairness due to faulty measurement.

Whether professionals in testing and assessment would consider adequacy or equality of opportunity to learn as essential for fairness generally depends not only on the instrument but also on the uses and interpretations that are made of the results. Thus, it would be considered fair to use results of an achievement test to document inequalities in education where there were substantial differences in opportunity to learn. But it would not be fair to use the test results as the basis for rewards or sanctions for students under those conditions. Nor would it be fair to infer that the group that was not provided with an adequate opportunity to learn was intellectually inferior or incapable of learning the material on the assessment.

It is often useful to distinguish between (a) the possible presence of bias in the test content and (b) the possible unfair use of test results. These factors are undoubtedly related, but we discuss them here separately.

In evaluating the possible presence of bias in test content, it is important to distinguish between the performance the test is intended to measure and factors that may distort the scores unfairly. In testing mathematics skills with story problems, for example, it is important to keep the reading level low so that the test scores are not contaminated by reading ability. If the reading level is too difficult, poor readers will obtain lower scores that warranted , and the test will be biased against them. Because a patticular minority group may have a dispropottionately large number of poor readers, the test may be biased against that minority group. But if the test of mathematics skills is not contaminated by reading or other factors, low scores will simply indicate lack of mathematics skills. Such a test is fair to evetyone even if the test scores indicate group differences in the mastery of mathematics.

In the past, standardized tests typically emphasized content and values that were more familiar to white middle-class students than to ractal or ethnic minorities and students of lower socioeconomic status. Thus, the content of some scholastic aptitude tests contained vocabulaty, P icUl res , and objects that minorities had less opportunity to learn. Similarly, some reading tests contained stories and situations that were unrelated to their life experiences. Racial and ethnic minorities were seldom represented in pictures, stories, and other test content, and when they were, it was sometimes in an offensive manner. How much these types of bias might have lowered the scores of individual students is impossible to say, but most persons familiar with testing would acknowledge some adverse effect. Fortunately, test publishers have taken steps to correct the situation. Test publishers now employ staff members representing various racial and cultural minorities, and new tests are routinely reviewed for content that might be biased or offensive to minority groups. Statistical analysis is also being used to detect and remove test items that function differently for different groups of test takers (Cole & Moss, 1989).

The most controversial problems concerning tile fair use of tests with minority groups are encountered when aptitude tests are used as a basis for educational and vocational selection. Much of the difficulty here is with tl1e definition of fair test use. One view is that a test is fair or unbiased if it predicts as accurately for minority groups as it does for the majority group. This traditional view, which favors a common cutoff score for selection, has been challenged as being unfair to minority groups because they often earn lower test scores, and thus a smaller proportion of qualified individuals tends to be selected. Alternative definitions of test fairness favor some type of adjustment, such as separate cutoff scores or bonus points, for some minorities.

Ultimately, the decision as to whether minority group membership is to be ignored or given special consideration in selection will not be made by educators or psychologists. The fair use of tests in selection is part of a larger issue that must be settled by society through court rulings. Stated in simplified form, the issue is how equal educational and occupational opportunities can best be provided for members of minority groups without infringing on the rights of other individuals.

##### Gender Fairness

The issues of fairness regarding testing and assessment have also attracted considerable attention in the use and interpretation of tests and assessments for males and females. For example, the use of scores on tests such as the Preliminary SAT (PSAT) as the basis for identifying National Merit Scholars has focused attention on the issue of gender bias in tests in recent years. On the mathematics section of the PSAT, the average score for males has been higher than the average score for females, and there have been more males than females with very high scores for many years. In recent years, the average score for males is also slightly higher than the average for females on the verbal section of these tests. As a consequence, a substantially larger percentage of male National Merit Scholars have been identified than female scholars. As a partial response to this difference, writing scores, on which females tend to score higher than males, have been added to the mix for identifying National Merit Scholars, thereby reducing the gender difference in recognition of scholars.

As in the case of differences in scores of racial or ethnic groups, the existence of a difference in average scores for males and females does not necessarily imply that the test is biased. There are, for example, differences in the number of mathematics courses taken by females and males in high school, and these differences may lead to differences in the scores on the mathematics tests (Willingham & Cole, 1997). Whatever the cause of the differences, however, it does not change the fact that use of the tests alone results in a larger proportion of scholarships being awarded to males than to females despite the fact that females earn higher grades in school than males on average. Judgments about the proper use of test scores must rest on more than technical evaluations of the tests or the degree to which the scores reflect real differences in knowledge, skills, and developed abilities rather than unintentional biases. Such judgments also involve questions of social values and social policy.

Although not a minority group, women have had some of the same problems as minorities have in attempting to obtain equal educational and occupational opportunities. Thus, in the use of test results in career planning, care needs to be taken so that test scores are not unfairly used to direct females away from certain occupations. For example, females tend to score lower than males on mechanical comprehension tests and to have lower mechanical interest scores. Although these differences probably reflect cultural influences rather than sex bias in the tests, it would be unfortunate if such results were used to limit the occupations females might consider as possible careers.

**Information About the Construction and Use of Formative Assessments**

The Assessment Training Institute (http://www.assessmentinst.com) offers books and videos that are designed to help K-12 educators construct and use formative assessments.

Willingham and Cole (1997) have reported a comprehensive set of analyses examining differences in the performance of males and females on a variety of types of tests and assessments. They also have investigated factors related to the differences found and comparability in the validity of the measures when they are used for various purposes, such as predicting subsequent performance of males and females.

##### Formative Assessments

Several distinctions can be made between formative assessments and mandated tests. First, classroom teachers control the timing and use of formative assessments, whereas mandated tests are controlled from afar and must be administered on a schedule dictated by the state or district. Second, formative assessments are flexible and may be adapted to the instructional needs of individual students, whereas external tests are standardized and uniform for all students. Moreover, as noted, external tests provide evaluations of student learning whereas formative assessments provide measures for learning; that is, the main purpose of formative assessments is to provide information that can be used to guide instruction and enhance student learning.

To be effective tools of teaching and learning, formative assessments must be consistent with important student learning goals (see, for example, Shepard, 2001). Teachers must be able to control the time that formative assessments are administered and the choice of tasks that students are asked to perform. The assessments must provide feedback to students and teachers (Black & Wiliam, 1998). Rubrics that teachers use to score constructed responses to assessment tasks must be transparent and made part of the feedback to students. Clear instructional goals and specifications of assessment tasks, together with transparent scoring rubrics, can contribute to improved learning by helping students use self-assessments to monitor their own progress.

#### SUMMARY

You are likely to encounter a number of externally mandated testing and assessment programs in schools. As a teacher, you may be directly involved in some of the programs. Others you may simply need to know about so that you can serve as an informed professional in dealing with students, parents, and the public. These programs have

CourseSmart

generally contributed to expanded testing and assessment in the schools, which in turn have a-eated new trends and raised concerns. You will also have opportunities to construct and use formative assessments. When properly used, the latter assessments can be effective tools for enhancing instruction and student learning. Subsequent chapters provide elaborations of these ideas.

Demands for accountability have led to substantial increases in the amount of testing and assessment in the schools and in the importance that is attached to the scores. Minimum-competency testing programs that required students to pass tests to receive high sd1001 diplomas or to be promoted to the next grade grew rapidly throughout the country in the late *1970s.* Demands for comparisons of schools, Sd1001 districts, and states in tenns of student achievement test scores led to the introduction of still more testing and assessment requirements and ina-eased the stakes for teachers and school administrators.

In recent years, emphasis has been placed on establishing demanding content and performance standards for all students. The demanding performance standards have increased the stakes associated with assessment-based accountability systems in a number of states. At the same time, the pressllfe to indude all students has presented new d1allenges in developing assessments and administration procedures that provide adequate accommodations for students with special needs or students who are English-language learners.

The NCLB Act of 2001 has requirements for increases in the amount of testing that states had mandated before the act became law. It reinforces the role of content and student performance standards. Most important, the act requires states to use student test results to hold schools and districts accountable for student acheivement in reading or language arts and mathematics and, beginning with the 2007-2008 school year, in science.

Several changes in educational measurement have been broad enough and persistent enough to be identified as trends. In addition to the expanded uses of tests that have just been summarized, developments are d1anging the nature of testing and assessment. Most notable of these developments is the increased emphasis on performance-based assessment. Concerns that tests and assessments strongly influence what gets taught have led to increased emphasis on making assessments that correspond as dosely as possible to complex learning objectives that are not readily measured by conventional tests. Demands for new forms of assessment have led to changes in approaches being used to measure tead1er performance as well as student perfonnance.

Technological developments also promise to change the nature of testing and assessment. Computers provide a means of making tests adaptive to the individual test taker and consuucting realistic simulations to test problem-solving skills. On-line, computer-based testing has certain potential advantages over traditional paper-and-pencil tests. In addition to making adaptive testing, on-line testing provides immediate access to results and may be espedally useful as part of an early warning system and in preparing for highstakes tests. On-line testing may also provide cost savings. The biggest hurdle to wider implementation of computer-based, on-line testing is the demand for access to computers in the schools that exceeds current availability in many places.

Critics of testing have raised issues concerning the possible consequences of testing in the Sd1001s. Most of the criticism has been directed toward standardized tests, induding such issues as the nature and quality of the tests, the possible hannful effects of testing on students, and the fairness of tests to minorities and women. It is impOltant to recognize the multiple perspectives on what constinJtes fairness in testing and assessment, including the absence of bias, procedural fairness, adequacy of opportunity to learn, and equality of outcomes. Although the nature of the test or assessment itself requires close attention in considering issues of fairness, in many instances it is the use or misuse of the results of tests and assessments that is most critical to achieving fairness.

Formative assessments constructed by classroom teachers differ from external tests in a number of ways. They are less formal and may be administered at different times throughout the school year as deemed appropriate by the needs of individual students. They can contribute to improvements in instmction and student learning by providing timely feedback and by clarifying expectations in ways that snJdents can use for purposes of ongoing self-assessment.

### **CHAPTER 2 THE ROLE OF MEASUREMENT AND ASSESSMENT IN TEACHING**

A ssessment of student learning requires the use of techniques for measuring student achievement. Assessment *is* more than a collection of techniques, however. It is a systematic process that plays a significant role in effective teaching. It begins with the identification of learning goals, monitors the progress students make toward those goals, and ends with a judgment concerning the extent to which those goals have been artained .

The abundance of external mandates for tests and assessments discussed in Chapter 1 make it evident that students in the United States are subjected to a great deal of testing and assessment just as a consequence of those mandates; but measurement and assessment include mucl1 more than standardized tests. Students spend considerably more time taking teacherconstnlcted tests and tests selected by teacl1ers from materials furnished by publishers than they do taking standardized tests. Even the addition of teacher-constructed and teacherselected tests leaves us with an incomplete picture of the domain of measurement and assessment. Formal assessments of student worksheets, homework assignments, projects, and term papers further expand the concept of the domain but still leave it incomplete because many of the assessments that are critical to the moment -by-moment classroom activities are inforn1a1.

Informal classroom observation guides many instructional decisions. For example, oral questioning of students may indicate the need for a complete review of the material, class discussion may reveal misunderstandings that must be corrected on the spot, and interest in a topic may suggest that more time should be spent on it than originally planned. Similarly in observing indivdual students a teacher decides that Sandra  help in writing a complete paragraph, that Mike needs more practice in doing mathematics problems, that Juan and Donna should be given remedial work in reading, and tl1at Maria should be encouraged to read more challenging books.

Instructional decisions such as these are made continually during the process of teadling. Some are based on students' oral responses, some on the actual performance of a skill, and others on a student's quizzical look, tone of voice, or physical behavior. All are based on the tead1er's moment-by-moment observations. Although these obselvations are informal, they play an indispensable role in effective teaching.

Tests and other procedures for measuring student learning are not intended as replacements for the teacher's informal observations and judgments. Rather, they are intended to complement and supplement the teacher's informal methods of obtaining information about students. The teacher is still the observer and decision maker. Measurement and assessment procedures merely provide more systematic, objective evidence on which to base instructional decisions.

#### **INSTRUCTIONAL DECISIONS REQUIRING ASSESSMENT DATA**

Numerous decisions made by teachers require them to supplement their infonnal observations of students with more systenlatic measures of aptitudes, achievement, and personal development. It would not be feasible to make an exhaustive list of all such decisions, but it is possible to identify some of the more common ones. The following list of questions illustrates some of the major instructional decisions teachers are likely to encounter during the course of their teaching. Examples of the types of measurement and assessment procedures that nlight be most helpful in answeling the questions are included in parentheses.

- 1. How realistic are my teacl1ing plans for this particular group of students? (scholastic aptitude tests, past record of achievement)
- 2. How should the students be grouped for more effective learning? (teacherconstructed tests, past record of achievement, obselvation)
- 3. To what extent are the students ready for the next learning experience? (pretests of needed skills, past record of achievement)
- 4. To what extent are students attaining the learning goals of the course? (teacherconstructed tests, class projects, oral questioning, obselvation)
- 5. To what extent are students progressing beyond the minimum essentials? (teacherconstructed tests, general achievement tests, class projects, portfolios of student work, obselvation)
- 6. A what point would a review be most beneficial?(periodc, quizzes, oral  questioning, obselvation)
- 7. What types of learning difficulties are the students encountering? (diagnostic tests, obselvation, oral questioning, pOltfolios of work products, student conferences)
- 8. Whid1 students should be referred to counseling, special classes, or remedial programs? (scholastic aptitude tests, achievement tests, diagnostic tests, obselvation)
- 9. Which students have poor self-understanding? (self-ratings, student conferences)
- **10.** Whid1 school grade should be assigned to eacl1 student? (review of pOltfolio of all assessment data)
- 11. What should parents be told about the progress of their child? (review of portfolio of all assessment data)
- 12. How effective was my teaching? (achievement tests, students' ratings, selfreflection, supervisors' ratings)

This list of questions highlights the need for various types of information in teaching, but instructional decisions are not so neatly ordered. There are always numerous subquestions to be answered and an overlap among the various decisions. Many different types of assessment data might be useful in a particular situation. The teaching-learning process involves a continuous and interrelated series of instructional decisions concerning ways to enhance student learning. Our main point here, however, is that the effectiveness of the instruction depends to a large extent on the nature and quality of the information on which the decisions are based.

#### ASSESSMENT, TEST, AND MEASUREMENT

The terms assessment, test, and measurement are easily confused because all may be involved in a single process. Assessment is a general term that includes the full range of procedures used to gain information about student learning (observations, ratings of performances or projects, paper-and-pencil tests) and the formation of value judgments concerning learning progress. A test is a particular type of assessment that typically consists of a set of questions administered during a fixed period of time under reasonably comparable conditions for all students. We sometimes use testing and assessment together even though tests are a specific type of assessment. When used in this way, assessment emphasizes the broader array of performances and projects that might not be called to mind by the word testing. Measurement is the assigning of numbers to the results of a test or other type of assessment according to a specific rule (e.g., counting correct answers or awarding points for particular aspects of an essay). The specific meaning of each term is summarized in the box "Terminology."

![](_page_37_Picture_6.jpeg)

 TERMINOLOGY

Assessment: Any of a variety of procedures used to obtain information about student performance. Includes traditional paperand-pencil tests as well as extended responses (e.g., essays), performances of authentic tasks (e.g., laboratory experiments), teacher observations, and student self-report. Assessment answers the question: "How well does the individual perform?"

Test: An instrument or systematic procedure for measuring a sample of behavior by

posing a set of questions in a uniform manner. Because a test is a form of assessment, tests also answer the question: "How well does the individual performeither in comparison with others or in comparison with a domain of performance tasks?"

Measurement: The process of obtaining a numerical description of the degree to which an individual possesses a particular characteristic. Measurement answers the question: "How much?"

![](_page_38_Figure_1.jpeg)
The assessment process

*Assessment* is a much more comprehensive and inclusive term than *measurement* or *testing.* The term *measurement* is limited to quantitative descriptions of students; that is, the results of measurement are always expressed in numbers (e.g., Alex correctly solved 35 of the 40 mathematics problems). It does not include qualitative descliptions (e.g., Laura's work was neat), nor does it imply judgments concernlng the worth or value of tlle obtained results. Assessment, on the otller hand, may include bOtll quantitative desoÂ·iptions (measurement) and qualitative descriptions (nonmeasurement) of students. In addition, assessment always includes value judgments concerning me desirability of the results. Figure 2.1 shows the comprehensive nature of assessment and the role of measurement and nonmeasurement techniques in the assessment process. As noted in the diagram, assessment mayor may not be based on measurement; when it is, it goes beyond simple quantitative descriptions.

#### **GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ASSESSMENT**

Assessment is an integrated process for determining the nature and extent of student learning and development. This process will be most effective when tlle following prindples are taken into consideration.

**1.** Clearly specifying what is to be assessed has priority **in** the assessment process. The effectiveness of assessment depends as much on a careful desoÂ·iption of what to assess as it does on the technical qualities of the assessment procedures used. Thus, specification of the dla.racteristics to be measured should precede the selection or development of assessment procedures. When assessing student learning, this means clearly specifying the intended learning goals before selecting the assessment procedures to use.

General statements from content standards or from course objectives can be a helpful starting point, but in most cases teachers will need to add greater specificity for the assessment process to be effective. For example, a content standard in the area of history might specify that students should "understand ideas and documents within historical contexts." For a content standard stated at that general level, a variety of multiplechoice, short-answer, or essay questions might be considered relevant. To establish assessment priolities for such a standard, teachers need to answer questions such as the following: What ideas? What documents? What historical context? What constitutes adequate evidence of understanding? Such questions are not answered by the general statement in the standard, but they must be answered, either explicitly or implicitly, to develop assessments.

2. An assessment procedure should be selected because of its relevance to the characteristics or performance to be measured. Assessment procedures are frequently selected on the basis of tl1eir objectivity, accuracy, or convenience. Although these cliteria are important, they are secondary to the main cliterion: Is iliis procedure the most effective method for measuring tl1e learning or development to be assessed? EvelY procedure discussed in subsequent chapters is appropriate for certain uses and inappropriate for others. Any specific test may also be appropriate for celtain uses and inappropriate for others. In assessing student acl1ievement, for example, we need a close match between the intended learning goals and the types of assessment tasks used. If the development of the ability to organize ideas and write a well-integrated composition is a learning goal, then a multiplechoice test on the mechanics of writing wouid be a poor substitute for assessments based on analyses of student writing under a variety of conditions (e.g., in-class essay tests, writing projects, and term papers).

3. Comprehensive assessment requires a variety of procedures. No single type of instrument or procedure can assess the vast anay of learning and development outcomes emphasized in a school program. Multiple-chOice and shOtt-answer tests of achievement are useful for measuring knowledge, understanding, and application outcomes, but essay tests and other written projects are needed to assess the ability to organize and express ideas. Projects iliat require students to formulate problems, accumulate infonnation through library research, or collect clata (e.g., tl1roUgh experimental observations or interviews) are needed to measure cenain skills in fonnulating and solving problems. Observational teclmiques are needed to assess pelformance skills and various aspects of student behavior; and self-repon techniques are useful for assessing interests and attitudes. A comolete picture of student acheivement and development requires the use of many different assessment procedures.

4. Proper use of assessment procedures requires an awareness of their limitations. Assessment procedures range from highly developed measuring instruments (e.g., standardized aptitude and achievement tests) to rather crude assessment devices (e.g., observational and self-report techniques). Even me best educational and psychological measuring instruments yield results that are subject to various types of measurement error.

No test or assessment asks all the questions or poses all the problems that might appropriately be presented in a comprehensive coverage of the knowledge, skills, and understanding relevant to the content standards or objectives of a course or instructional sequence. Instead, only a sample of the relevant problems or questions is presented. Even in a relatively narrow part of a content domain, such as understanding photosynthesis or the addition and subtraction of fractions, a host of problems might be presented, but any given test or assessment samples but a small fraction of those problems. Consequently, sampling error is one conunon problem in educational and psychological measurement. An achievement test may not adequately sample a particular domain of instructional content, and even a good sample of items will not completely cover the domain. An observational instrument designed to assess a student's social adjustment may not sample enough behavior for a dependable index of this trait. Fortunately, sampling error can be controlled through careful application of established measurement procedures.

A second source of error is caused by chance factors influencing assessment results, such as guessing on objective tests, subjective scoring on essay tests, errors in judgment on observation devices, and inconsistent responding on self-rep on instruments (e.g., attitude scales). Because of these problems, students just a few points apalt on an educational assessment should not be considered to be different. In fact, no score on an educational or psychological assessment should be treated as a totally accurate measurement of the characteristic in question. TIuuugh the careful use of assessment procedures, we are able to keep these errors of measurement to a minimum. (We consider the topic of measurement error in greater detail in dlapter 5.)

The incorrect interpretation of measurement results constitutes another major source of error. Users of educational assessments sometimes interpret results as more precise than they are or as an indication of characteristics beyond those the assessment is designed to measure. For instance, scholastic aptitude scores are sometimes misinterpreted as measures of innate abilities rather than as modifiable abilities or as a measure of general personal worth rather than as a limited measure of verbal and numerical reasoning. Misinterpretation of test results is all too common and is one of the major considerations concerning the validity of an assessment that is considered in Chapter 4. Avoiding misinterpretation requires careful attention to what the test actually measures, how accurately it does so, and its intended uses.

These limitations of assessment procedures do not negate the value of tests and other types of assessments. A keen awareness of the limitations of assessment instruments makes it possible to use them more effectively. Keep in mind that the cruder the instrument, the greater its limitations and, consequently, the more caution required in its use.

;. Assessment is a means to all end: not an end in itself. The use of assessment procedures implies that some useful pLllpose is being served and that the user is clearly aware of this purpose. To blindly gather data about students and then file the infonnation away is a waste of both time and effOit. Wasting time and effort of the students, teachers, and other users of the information will have negative effects on later assessments. Motivation to take assessment seriously will be influenced by the teachers and students understanding the reasons for the assessments and their appropriate use. Assessment is best viewed as a process of obtaining information on which to base imponant educational decisions.

#### **ASSESSMENT AND THE INSTRUCTIONAL PROCESS**

The main purpose of classroom instruction is to help students achieve a set of intended learning goals. These goals should typically include desired changes in the intellectual, emotional, and physical spheres. When classroom instruction is viewed in this light, assessment becomes an integral part of the teaching-learning process. The intended learning outcomes are established by the instructional goals, the desired changes in students are brought about by the planned learning activities, and the students' learning progress is periodically assessed by tests and other assessment devices. Although the interdependent nature of teaching and learning is beyond dispute, the interdependent nature of teacl1ing, learning, and assessment is less often recognized.

The statements in the box "Measurement and Assessment- Essential Components of Effective Teaching" attest to the fact that leaders in the advancement of teaching as a profession recognize the critical role of assessment as an integral part of effective teacl1ing. The interdependence of these three facets of education can be clearly seen in the following steps included in the instructional process.

##### **Identifying Instructional Goals**

The first step in both teacl1ing and assessment is determining the learning outcomes to be expected from classroom instruction. How should students think and act when they complete the learning experience? What knowledge and understanding should the students pos*sess?* What skills should they be able to display? What interests and attitudes should they have deveioped? What changes in habits of thinking, feeiing, and doing shouid have taken place? In ShOlt, for what spedfic cl1anges are we striving, and what are students like when we have succeeded in bringing about these changes? Content standards and cuniculum guidelines established by a state or district provide a useful starting point for specifying instI1lction goals, but they almost always require elaboration and additional spedfidty in order to identify specific goals for students and to guide the details of assessment development. Chapter 3 provides guidance in the process of clarifying instructional goals and objectives.

##### **Preassessing the Learners' Needs**

When the instructional goals have been clearly spedfied, it is usually desirable to make some assessment of the learners' needs in relation to the learning outcomes to be achieved. Do the students possess the abilities and skills needed to proceed with the instruction? Have the students already developed the skills and understanding intended? Assessing students' knowledge and skills at the beginning of instruction enables us to answer sucl1 questions. This infonnation is useful in planning work for students who lack the prerequisite skills and in modifying our instructional plans to fit the needs of the learners.

##### **Providing Relevant Instruction**

Relevant instruction takes place when course content and teaching methods are integrated into planned instructional activities designed to help students achieve the intended learning outcomes. During this instructional phase, measurement and assessment provide

a means of monitoring learning progress and diagnosing learning difficulties. Thus, periodic assessment during insU1.lction provides a type of feedback-corrective procedure that aids in continuously adapting instruction to group and individual needs.

Many of the assessments that take place during instruction that enable teachers to monitor and make adjustments are seamlessly integrated into insU1.lctional activities. For example, the instructional activity might be group work on a sdence problem, but during the group activity a teacher may observe that Noah is doing most of the talking and handson work with the apparatus while others in the group are largely passive observers. Such observations allow teacllers to make adjustments as the work progresses. On the other hand, a short quiz or question-and-answer period may be used to check on the understanding that each individual student is acquiring through the group activity.

##### **Assessing the Intended learning Outcomes**

The final step in the instructional process is to determine the extent to which the learning objectives were achieved by the students. This is accomplished by using tests and other types of assessments that are specifically designed to measure the intended learning outcomes. Ideally, the content standards and instructional goals will clearly specify the desired cllanges in students, and the assessment inSU1.lments will provide a relevant measure or description of the extent to which those changes have taken place. Matching a range of assessment: procedures to the intended learning outcomes, with particular emphasis on those that are judged to be most important, is basic to effective classroom assessment, and the link between the assessment procedures and the intended learning outcomes receives considerable attention in later chapters

##### **Using the Results**

Student assessment is often regarded as being essentia.lly for the benefit of teachers and administrators. This attitude overlooks the direct contribution that assessment can make to students. Properly used assessment procedures can contribute directly to improved student learning by (a) clarifying the nature of the intended learning outcomes, (b) proViding short-teIID goals to work toward, (c) proViding feedback concerning learning progress, Cd) proViding information for overcoming learning difficulties and for selecting future learning experiences, and (e) identifying the next instructional goal. Although these purposes are probably best served by the periodic assessment during instruction, the final assessment of intended outcomes also should contribute to these ends.

Information from carefully developed tests and odler types of assessments also can be used to improve instructIon. Such information can aId in judging (a) the appropriateness and attainability of dle instructional goals, (b) the usefulness of the instructional materials, and (c) the effectiveness of dle instructional methods. Thus, assessment procedures can contIibute to improvements in the teaching-learning process itself and contribute directly to improved student learning.

Assessment results are, of course, also used for assigning marks and reporting student progress to parents. As discussed in Chapter 12, portfolios of student work can provide an effective mechanism for communicating student progress to parents in ways that not only give greater meaning to traditional marks or grades but also illustrate tlle areas where

![](_page_44_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](_page_44_Figure_2.jpeg)

parents may help students with their learning. The systematic use of a wide range of assessment procedures provides an objective and comprehensive basis for reporting on each student's learning progress. In addition to marking and reporting, assessment results also are used in the school for various administrative and guidance functions. They are useful in cun-iculum development, in aiding students with educational and vocational decisions, and in assessing the effectiveness of the Sd100l program. The simplified instructional model shown in Figure 2.2 summarizes the basic steps in the instructional process and illustrates the inten-elated nature of teaching, learning, and assessment.

#### TYPES OF ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

The assessment process may include a wide variety of procedures. These may be classified and described in many different ways, depending on the frame of reference used. Here we present those bases for classification that are most useful for understanding and using assessment procedures in teaching. Although the categories are not discrete, they provide a good general overview of assessment procedures and a useful introduction to some basic terms. The specific procedures used in classroom assessment are described and illustrated in later chapters.

##### Maximum Performance Versus Typical Performance

à¶§ à·à·à¶­

Tests and other types of assessments may be placed in two broad categories on the basis of the nature of the measurement. These have been labeled by Cronbach (1990) as measures of maximum performance and measures of typical performance. In the first category are those procedures used to determine a person's developed abilities or achievements. Procedures of this type are concerned with how well individuals perform when they are motivated to obtain as high a score as possible. In short, the assessment results indicate what individuals can do when they put forth their best effort. Aptitude and achievement tests are included in this category. A distinction between these two types of tests is commonly made in terms of the use of the results rather than of the qualities of the tests themselves. An aptitude test is designed primarily to predict success in some future learning activity, whereas an achievement test is designed to indicate degree of success in some past learning activity.

Because some tests may be used for both purposes, however, it is obvious that the difference is mainly a matter of emphasis. For example, an algebra test designed to measure achievement at the end of the course also may be used to predict success in future mathematics courses. Such overlapping of function prevents distinct classification, but the terms aptitude and achievement provide useful designations for discussions of measures of ability.

Although the intent of assessments of student achievement is to measure "maximum performance," they can do so only if students attempt to do their best when taking the assessment. If students are not motivated to try their best on a test, then the results obviously may underestimate each student's maximal performance. Thus, the notion of maximal performance refers to the intent of the assessment rather than what may be validly concluded from the score obtained by a student motivation to try their best on the test will be necessary for the results to be interpretable and useful.

The second category in this classification of procedures includes those designed to reflect a person's typical behavior. Procedures of this type are concerned with what individuals will do rather than what they can do. Methods designed to assess interests, attitudes, adjustment, and various personality traits are included in this category. Here the emphasis is on obtaining representative responses rather than high scores. Although this is an extremely important area in which to appraise students, assessments of typical behavior are fraught with difficulties. The limitations of testing instruments in this field have led to wide use of interviews, questionnaires, anecdotal records, ratings, and various other self-report and observational techniques. None of these techniques alone provides an adequate appraisal of typical behavior, but the combined results of a number of them enable the teacher to make fairly accurate judgments concerning student progress and change in these areas.

Pottfolios can be used as a measure of either typical or maximum performance. A portfolio can be prepared to show what a student can do by selecting "best" pieces of work, particularly to show the learning that has occuned. In contrast, a portfolio might include typical work from the year so that parents can understand the progress that a student has made. The purpose of the portfolio (maximum versus typical) will guide the types of work that are selected to be included and the interpretations and uses of the resulting portfolio.

##### **Fixed-Choice Tests and Complex-Performance Assessments**

The format of tests and assessments has been the subject of considerable debate and controversy in recent years. The multiple-chOice test item has been the most widely used format on standardized tests used in the United States for more than half a century. Multiple-choice and other variations of selected-response test items (e.g. , true-false, matching) are highly effident because students can respond to a relatively large number of questions in a brief period of time and the responses can be maciline scored. Objective scoring, high reliability for a given period of time, and cost effectiveness are major advantages of this technique.

Although selected-response tests have always had their critics, several perceived weaknesses of this testing format have attracted widespread attention in recent years. Of particular concern are the beliefs that (a) selected-response tests tend to overemphasize factual knowledge and low-level skills at the expense of higher-order problem-solving and conceptual skills and (b) such tests drive instruction in ways that are inconsistent with current understandings of cognition and learning that emphasize the importance of engaging students in the construction of knowledge and their own understandings rather than the accumulation of discrete facts and procedural skills (Resnick & Resnick, 1992).

DUling the 1990s, there was a groundswell of support for a quite different approach to measurement and assessment, one that relies on extended tasks and the analysis of complex student performances. Performance-assessment tasks are intended to closely reflect long-term instructional goals and require students to solve problems of importance outside the confines of the classroom or to perform in ways that are valued in their own right. Written essays are one example of a complex-performance task that reflects the instructional goal of effective communication more than a selected-response test could. Other examples include open-ended mathematics problems requiring extended responses, laboratory experiments in sdence, creation of a piece of art, oral presentations, projects, and exhibitions of student work.

Fixed-choice tests and compiex-performance assessments represent two ends of a continuum. Tests requiring the construction of short answers fall between the extremes. Even an essay test may fall shott of the intent of a complex-performance assessment if students are allowed only a brief period to respond , have no c110ice of topiC, and have no chance to revise. On the other hand, a fixed-choice item can reqUire more complex performance than recall of facts when carefully constructed.

Performance assessments are frequently referred to as "authentic assessments" to emphasize that they assess performance while students are engaged in problem-solving and learning experiences that are valued in their own right, not just as a means of appraising student achievement. However, not all performance assessments are "authentic" in the sense that they engage students in solving real problems.

Performance assessments are more time consuming to administer and score than fixed-choice tests. Human judgment is a critical part of scoring and requires a high degree of expertise and training. Selected-response tests and complex-performance assessment, as well as a range of intermediate techniques, are useful for assessing student achievement. As is highlighted in subsequent chapters, a full range of assessment procedures is needed, and the particular mix must be carefully tailored to the purposes of the assessment and to its impact on teaching and learning.

##### Placement, Formative, Diagnostic, and Summative Assessment

Tests and other assessment procedures can also be classified in terms of their functional role in classroom instruction. Identified some time ago by Airasian and Madaus (1972), one such classification system follows the sequence in which assessment procedures are likely to be used in the classroom. Their categories continue to be relevant today. They classified the assessment of student performance in the following manner.

- 1. Placement assessment: To determine student performance at the beginning of instruction
- 2. Formative assessment: To monitor learning progress during instruction
- 3. Diagnostic assessment: To diagnose learning difficulties during instruction
- 4. Summative assessment: To assess achievement at the end of instruction

Although a single instrument may sometimes be useful for more than one purpose (e.g., for both formative and summative assessment purposes), each of these types of classroom assessment typically requires instruments specifically designed for the intended use.

Placement Assessment. Placement assessment is concerned with the student's entry performance and typically focuses on questions such as the following: (a) Does the student possess the knowledge and skills needed to begin the planned instruction? For example, is a student's reading comprehension at a level that he or she can do the expected independent reading for a unit in history, or does the beginning algebra student have a sufficient command of essential mathematics concepts? (b) To what extent has the student already developed the understanding and skills that are the goals of the planned instruction? Sufficient levels of comprehension and proficiencies might indicate the desirability of skipping certain units or of being placed in a more advanced course. (c) To what extent do the student's interests, work habits, and personality characteristics indicate that one mode of instruction might be better than another (e.g., group instruction versus independent study)? Answers to questions such as these require the use of a variety of techniques: records of past achievement, pretests on course objectives, self-report inventories, observational techniques, and so on. The goal of placement assessment is to determine for each student the position in the instructional sequence and the mode of instruction that is most beneficial.

Formative Assessment. Formative assessment is used to monitor learning progress during instruction. Its purpose is to provide continuous feedback to both students and teachers concerning learning successes and failures. Feedback to students provides reinforcement of successful learning and identifies the specific learning errors and misconceptions that are in need of correction. Feedback to teachers provides information for modifying instruction and for prescribing group and individual work. Formative assessment depends heavily on specially prepared tests and assessments for each segment of instruction (e.g., unit, chapter). Tests and other types of assessment tasks used for formative assessment are most frequently teacher made, but customized tests made available by publishers of textbooks and other instructional materials also can serve this fu nction. Observational ted1niques are, of course, also useful in monitoring student progress and identifying learning errors. Because formative assessment is directed toward improving learning and instruction, the results are typically not used for assigning course grades.

Diagnostic Assessment. Diagnostic assessment is a highly specialized procedure. It is concerned with the persistent or recurring learning difficulties that are left unresolved by the standard corrective prescriptions of formative assessment. If a student continues to experience failure in reading, mathematiCS, or other subjects despite the use of presoÂ·ibed alternative methods of instruction, then a more detailed diagnosis is indicated . To use a medical analogy, formative assessment provides first-aid treatment for simple learning problems, and diagnostic assessment seard1es for the underlying causes of those problems that do not respond to first-aid treatment. Thus, diagnostic assessment is much more comprehensive and detailed. It involves the use of specially prepared diagnostic tests as well as various observational techniques. Serious learning disabilities also are likely to require the services of educational, psyd1010gical, and medical specialists and, given the appropriate diagnosis, the development of an individualized education plan for the student. The aim of diagnostic assessment is to determine the causes of persistent learning problems and to formulate a plan for remedial action.

Summa tive Assessment. Sllmmative assessment typically comes at the end of a course (or unit) of instruction. It is designed to determine the extent to which the instructional goals have been achieved and is used primarily for assigning course grades or for certifying student mastery of the intended learning outcomes. The techniques used in summative assessment are determined by the instructional goals, but they typically indude teachermade achievement tests, ratings on various types of performance (e.g., laboratolY, oral repon), and assessments of products (e.g., themes, drawings, research reports). These various sources of information about student achievement may be systematically collected into a pOltfolio that may be used to SUllunalize or showcase the student's accomplishments and progress. Although the main purpose of summative assessment is grading or the certification of student achievement, it also provides information for judging the appropriateness of the course objectives and the effectiveness of the instruction.

##### **Norm-Referenced and Criterion-Referenced Measurement**

How the results of tests and other assessment procedures are intelpreted also provides a method of classifying these instruments. There are two basic ways of interpreting student performance. Norm-referenced interpretation describes the performance in terms of the relative position held in some known group (e.g., typed better than 9()O/o of the class members). Criterion-referenced interpretation describes the specific performance that was

demonstrated (e.g., typed 40 words per minute without enÂ·or). When interpretations are confined to the attainment of a specific objective (e.g., capitalized all proper nouns), they are sometimes called *objective niferenced.* This is a type of criterion-referenced interpretation, but it does not cover as broad a domain of tasks as that typically used in criterion referencing. These concepts are defined more specifically in the box "Terminology."

Current standal'ds-based assessments provide a major example of criterion-referenced interpretations. Standards-based assessments are ones that are developed to be aligned with specific content standards and use a small number of levels of perfonnance for reporting based on fixed performance standruds. For example, the assessment results may be reported in terms of three to five categories of perfOImance (e.g., partially proficient, proficient, and advanced performance levels). The categorization of a student as meeting, say, the proficient performance standard does not depend on a compalison of that student's performance to that of other students. Rather, the reference is only to the criterion or cut score established by the profiCient performance standard. That is, a criterionreferenced interpretation is made of the performance on the standards-based assessment.

Norm-referenced interpret.1.tions depend on a comparison of a student's perfonnance to that of other students whose performance defines the norms. The nonns might be based on a local, state, or national group, depending on the use to be made of the results. Using national nonns, for example, we might describe a student's performance on a vocabulary test as equaling or exceeding that of 76% of a national sample of sixth graders. Criterionreferenced interpretations can be made in various ways. For example, we can (a) describe the specific learning tasks a student is able to perform (e.g., counts from 1 to 100), (b) indicate the percentage of tasks a student performs correctly (e.g. , spells 65% of the words in the word list or (c) compare the test performance to a set performane standard and make a decision that the student meets or fails to meet a given standard (e.g., performed at the proficient level). Although a performance standrud can be used in making one type of criterion-referenced interpretation, it is not an essential element of criterion-referenced assessment, as illustrated in the first two examples.

Although the term *percent* was used in illustrating both types of interpretation, it was used in a distinctly different way ead1 time. The norm-referenced interpretation indicated the student's relative standing in a norm group by noting the percentage of students in the group who obtained the same or a lower score (called a percentile score). The criterion-referenced

![](_page_49_Picture_5.jpeg)

Norm-referenced assessment: a test or other type of assessment designed to provide a measure of performance tl1at is interpretable in tenns of an individual's relative standing in some known group.

Criterion-referenced assessment: a test or other type of assessment designed to proVide a measure of performance that is interpretable in tenns of a cleruly defined and delimited domain of learning tasks.

atller tenns that are less often used but have meanings similar to criterion referenced: *standards based, objective referenced, content referenced, domain niferenced,* and *universe "eferenced* 

interpretation focused on the percentage of items answered correctly (called a percentagecorrect score). Although many types of scores are used in testing, the ctistinction between the percentile score and the percentage-correct score is a significant one because it illustrates the basic difference between a norm-referenced interpretation and a o Â·iterion-referenced interpretation.

Strictly speaking, "norm referenced" and "criterion referenced" refer only to the method of interpreting the results. However, these distinct types of interpretation are likely to be most meaningful and useful when tests (and other assessment instruments) are specifically designed for the type of interpretation to be made. Thus, it is legitimate to use the terms *criterion referenced* and *norm rfjemnced* as broad categories for classifying tests and other assessment procedures.

Tests and assessments that are specifically built to maximize one type of interpretation are impossible to identify merely by examining the test itself (see the box "Comparison of Norm-Referenced Tests and Criterion-Referenced Tests"). It is in the construction, interpretation, and use of the tests and assessments that differences can be noted. An identifying feature of norm-referenced tests is the selection of items of average difficulty and the elimination of items that all students are likely to answer correctly. This procedure provides a wide spread of scores so that discrimination among students at various levels of achievement is possible. This is useful for decisions based on relative achievement, such as selection, grouping, and relative grading. By contrast, cliterion-referenced tests include items that are directly relevant to tile learning outcomes to be measured witll0ut regard to whether the items can be used to discriminate among students. No attempt is made to eliminate easy items or alter their difficulty. If the learning tasks are easy, then test items will be easy. The goal of the criterion referenced tes is to obtain a description of the specific knowledge and skills each student can demonstrate. This information is useful for planning both group and individual instruction.

These two types of assessments are best viewed as the ends of a continuum rather than as a clear-cut dichotomy. As shown in tile follOWing continuum, the criterionreferenced test emphasizes description of performance, and the nann-referenced test emphasizes discrimination among individuals.

![](_page_50_Figure_5.jpeg)

In an attempt to capitalize on the best features of both, test publishers have attempted to make tlleir norm-referenced tests more descriptive, thus allowing for both normreferenced and oÂ·iterion-referenced interpretations. Similarly, test publishers have added norm-referenced interpretations to tests that were specifically built for criterion-referenced interpretation. The use of dual interpretation witll published tests seems to be an increasing trend that will move many tests more toward the center of the continuum. Although this involves some compromises in test constmction and some cautions in test interpretation, the increased versatility may contribute to more effective test use.

##### Comparison of Norm-Referenced Tests (NRTs) and Criterion-Referenced Tests (CRTs)\*

 Common Characteristics of NRTs and CRTs:

- 1. Both require specification of the achievement domain to be measured.
- 2. Both require a relevant and representative sample of test items.
- 3. Both use the same types of test items.
- 4. Both use the same rules for item writing (except for item difficulty).
- 5. Both are judged by the same qualities of goodness (validity and reliability).
- 6. Both are useful in educational orse Smart assessment.

 Differences Between NRTs and CRTs:

Remember, differences are only a matter of emphasis.

1. NRT: Typically covers a large domain of learning tasks, with just a few items measuring each specific task.

CRT: Typically focuses on a delimited domain of learning tasks, with a relatively large number of items measuring each specific task.

- 2. NRT: Emphasizes discrimination among individuals in terms of relative level of learning. CRT: Emphasizes description of what learning tasks individuals can and cannot perform.
- 3. NRT: Favors items of average difficulty and typically omits very easy and very hard items. CRT: Matches item difficulty to learning tasks, without altering item difficulty or omitting easy or hard items.
- 4. NRT: Interpretation requires a clearly defined group. CRT: Interpretation requires a clearly

defined and delimited achievement domain.

\*When each is built to maximize its type of interpretation.

#### SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT CATEGORIES

A summary of the basic ways of describing classroom tests and other assessment procedures is presented in Table 2.1. Further discussion of these assessment categories is encountered in later chapters.

##### Other Descriptive Terms

Some of the terms used to describe tests that are presented here as contrasting types are really the ends of a continuum (e.g., speed versus power tests).

Informal Versus Standardized Tests. Informal tests are those constructed by classroom teachers, whereas those designed by test specialists and administered, scored, and interpreted under standard conditions are called standardized tests.

Individual Versus Group Tests. Some tests are administered on a one-to-one basis using careful oral questioning (e.g., individual intelligence test), whereas others can be administered to a group of individuals.

Mastery Versus Survey Tests. Some achievement tests measure the degree of mastery of a limited set of specific learning outcomes, whereas others measure a student's general level of achievement over a broad range of outcomes. Mastery tests typically use criterionreferenced interpretations, and survey tests tend to emphasize norm-referenced interpretations, but some criterion-referenced interpretations also are possible with carefully prepared survey tests.

Supply Versus Fixed-Response Tests. Some tests require examinees to supply the answer (e.g., essay test), whereas others require them to select one of two or more fixed-response options (e.g., multiple-choice test).

Speed Versus Power Tests. A speed test is designed to measure the number of items an individual can complete in a given time, whereas a power test is designed to measure level of performance under ample time conditions. Power tests usually have the items arranged in order of increasing difficulty.

Objective Versus Subjective Tests. An objective test is one on which equally competent examinees will obtain the same scores (e.g., multiple-choice test), whereas a subjective test is one in which the scores are influenced by the opinion or judgment of the person doing the scoring (e.g., essay test).

#### SUMMARY

Measurement and assessment play an important role in the instructional program of the school. They provide information that can be used in a variety of educational decisions. The main emphasis in classroom assessment, however, is on decisions concerning student learning and development.

From an instructional standpoint, assessment may be defined as a systematic process of determining the extent to which instructional objectives (i.e., intended learning outcomes) are achieved by students. The assessment process includes both measurement procedures (e.g., tests) and nonmeasurement procedures (e.g., informal observation) for describing changes in student performance as well as value judgments concerning the desirability of the changes.

The process of assessment is likely to be most effective when guided by a set of general principles. These principles emphasize the importance of (a) clearly specifying what is to be assessed, (b) selecting assessment procedures in terms of their relevance, (c) using a variety of assessment procedures, (d) being aware of their limitations, and (e) regarding assessment as a means to an end and not an end in itself.

The interrelated nature of teaching, learning, and assessment can be seen in the following sequential steps in the instructional process: (a) preparing instructional goals and objectives, (b) preassessing learners' needs, (c) providing relevant instruction (monitoring learning progress and diagnosing difficulties), (d) assessing the intended learning outcomes, and (e) using the assessment results to improve learning and instruction. In addition to the direct contribution that testing and assessment make to classroom instruction, they also play an important role in marking and repOlting, curriculum development, educational and vocational guidance, and assessing the effectiveness of the school program.

The vast array of assessment procedures used in the school can be classified and described in many different ways. The following are especially useful designations for describing the various procedures.

#### Nature 0 f the Assessment

- 1. Maximum perfonnance (what a person can do)
- 2. Typical perfonnance (what a person will do)

#### Fonnat of Assessment

- 1. Selected-response test (student selects response to question from available options)
- 2. Complex-performance assessment (student constmcts extended response or performs in response to complex task)

#### Use in Classroom Instruction

- 1. Placement assessment (measures entty behavior)
- 2. Formative assessment (monitors learning progress)
- 3. Diagnostic assessment (identifies causes of learning problems)
- 4. Surnmative assessment (measures end-of-course achievement)

#### Method oflnterpreting the Results

- 1. Noml referenced (describes student performance in terms of the relative position h~lrI ,~ "~ ~~ ~~~ ~ ~ â¢â¢ ~ .. ~, **l.lCIU lil ':'VlllC l\.llU\'VlJ** ~lVUP)
- 2. Criterion referenced (describes student pelformance in terms of a clearly defined and delin1ited domain of learning tasks)

Other terms used to describe tests and other assessment instruments include the following contrasting types.

Informal and standardized Individual and group Mastery and survey Supply and fixed response Speed and power Objective and subjective

### **CHAPTER 3: INSTRUCTIONAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: FOUNDATION FOR ASSESSMENT**

Wmt types of learning outcomes do you ell..rpect from your teaching? Knowledge? Understanding? Applications? Thinking skills? Problem-solving skills? Pelfol1nance skills? Attitudes? Clearly. defining desired learning outcomes is the first step in good teaching. It is also essential to the assessment of student learning. Sound assessment requires relating the assessment procedures as directly as possible to intended learning outcomes.

Instructional goals and objectives playa key role in both the instructional process and the assessment process. They serve as guides for both teaching and learning, communicate the intent of the instruction to others, and provide guidelines for assessing student learning. These major purposes are illustrated in Figure 3.1.

Beginning in the late 1980s and continuing to the present, there were numerous attempts, as part of national and state educational reform efforts, to rethink the major goals of instruction. This rethinking was epitomized by publication of the Cunicutum and Evaluation *Standards* by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (1989) and more recently updated in the form of the *Principles and Standards* for *School Mathematics* (NCTM, 2000). The NCTM standards have served as a model for other content areas working to establish new curriculum standards. With the encouragement and SUppoll of foundations and the federal goverrunent, national efforts to establish subject-matter standards were initiated in a variety of areas, including English, science, histOly, geography, social studies, civics, economics, foreign languages, physical education, and the arts. A key characteristic of these efforts is that they seek to estabilish more ambitious instructional goals for all students

The NCTM standards illustrate what are called content standards in the federal Goals 2000: Educate America Act of 1994 and in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The first two NCTM standards for grades K to 4 are shown in Figure 3.2. Although these brief

standards are described in more detail in the NCTM's publication, they are general descriptions of the knowledge, skills, and understandings that should be taught. They provide a broad framework from which more specific curriculum guidelines, instructional materials, and assessments may be developed.

A number of states and districts provide more detailed curriculum guidelines and associated instructional materials. Such guidelines and materials specify the types of performance students are expected to demonstrate at the end of the instructional sequence (e.g., unit or course). Describing intended learning outcomes in performance terms is the main function of properly stated instructional goals and objectives. This clarification of what students should be learning and how the learning is to be expressed not only aids the teacher but also helps others understand the focus of the instruction. Some states and districts are beginning to emphasize the importance of learning outcomes to the process of education by developing guidelines for outcomes-based education and tying graduation or grade retention requirements to the attainment of learning goals.

Examples of content standards in different subjects from five states are illustrated in Figure 3.3. The subject areas and grade ranges for state content standards vary from state

Colorado, Geography, Standard 4: "Students understand how economic, political, cultural, and social processes interact to shape patterns of human populations, interdependence, cooperation, and conflict. . . . In grades K-4, what students know and are able to do includes . . . identifying the causes of human migration" (Colorado Model Content Standards for Geography, Colorado Department of Education, Adopted, June 1995, Amended, November 1995; available: http://www.cde.state.co.us/download/pdf/geography.pdf).

New York State Standard 4: Science "students will understand and apply scientific concepts, principles, and theories pertaining to the physical setting and living environment and recognize the historical development of ideas in science" (Learning Standards of New York State; available: http://www.emsc.nyse.gov/ciai/pub/standards.pdf).

California Reading Comprehension Standard: "Read and orally respond to familiar stories and other texts by answering factual comprehension questions about cause-and-effect relationships. Read and orally respond to stories and texts from content areas by restating facts and details to clarify ideas" (California English-Language Development Standards for California Public Schools: Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve, July 1999; available: http://www.cde.ca.gov/cdepress/Eng-Lang-Dev-Stnd.pdf).

Florida Grades 6-8 Mathematics Standard 5: "The student understands and applies theories related to numbers. 1. Uses concepts about numbers, including primes, factors, and multiples, to build number sequences" (Florida Sunshine Standards; available: http://www.firn. edu/doe/curric/prek12/pdf/math6.pdf).

Virginia, Grade 3, History and Social Science Standards of Learning, Standard 3.1. "The student will explain how the contributions of ancient Greece and Rome have influenced the present world in terms of architecture, government (direct and representative democracy), and sports" (History and Social Science Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools, March 2001; available: http://www.pen.kqw.va.us/VDOE/superintendent/Sols/historysol2001.pdf).

Examples of state content standards statements

to state. **In** Colorado, for example, four separate sets of content standards were adopted for histOIY, geography, civics, and economics. Some states, such as Virginia , have grade- level-specific standards, whereas other states have standards adopted for a range of grades, and a few states have grade-level-specific standards as well as standards covering a range of grades (e.g. , Florida). The standards also valY from state to state in terms of their spedficity and emphases within a content area. Links to content standards by subject area and by state are provided at *http'//edstandards.orglstandards.html.* 

State content standards have been reviewed and graded (American Federation of Tead1ers, 2001; *Education Week,* 2006; Gross, 2005; and others). We do not attempt to evaluate the different perspectives brought to bear in the various reviews of state standards or the grades assigned to the standards by the reviewers. It is worth acknowledging, however, that the reviews have come to quite different conclusions about the state standards, in large part because the reviewers use different criteria for judging the standards. The reviewers differ not only in the importance given to the specifidty and rigor of the standards but also in their views on the priority that should be given to basic skills and factual knowledge in comparison to applications of ideas to solve problems in contexts outside the dassroom. The key point for present purposes, however, is that content standards can and should, if they are to be more than window dressing, influence the emphasis given to different topics within a content area and the assessments developed by teachers as well as those developed and required by states or districts.

Our interest in this book, of course, is in the usefulness of instlUctional goals objectives for assessing student learning. As noted in Chapter 2, effective assessment depends as much on a dear description of what is to be assessed as on a determination of how to assess.Thus before we develop or select test and other assessment instruments to measure student learning, we need to dearly spedfy the intended learning outcomes. That is the main function of well-stated instIuctional goals and objectives. State or district content standards provide a starting pOint, but given the general level at which most content standards are written, there is a need to elaborate the standards in order to dearly specify the learning outcomes in a fonn that can guide instruction and assessment in the classroom.

#### **INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES AS LEARNING OUTCOMES\***

Instluctional goals and objectives are sometimes stated in terms of actions to be taken. Thus, we might have a statement such as this:

Although this statement clearly indicates what the teaching activity is, it is less dear about intended learning outcomes and does not point explicitly to the type of student assessment that would be most appropriate. Literally, the objective will have been achieved when the demonstration has been completed- regardless if the students have learned anything. A better way to state objectives is in terms of what we expect students to be able to do at

Some of the material in this chapter was adapted from N. E. Gronlund, *How to write and use instrnctionalobjectives,* 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2000).

 Figure 3.4

The relationship of learning experience to learning outcomes

the end of instruction. After demonstrating how to use the microscope, for example, we might expect students to be able to demonstrate skill in using the microscope to identify features of a cell.

A statement such as this directs attention to the students and to the types of performance they are expected to exhibit as a result of the instruction. Thus, our focus shifts from the teacher to the student and from the learning experiences to the learning outcomes. This shift in focus makes clear the intent of our instruction and sets the stage for assessing student learning. Well-stated outcomes make clear the types of student performance we are willing to accept as evidence that the instruction has been successful.

When viewing instructional objectives in terms of learning outcomes, it is important to keep in mind that we are concerned with the products of learning rather than with the process of learning. This is not meant to suggest that the process is unimportant. Quite the contrary, processes such as writing notes, outlining, drafting, and revision in developing a written essay may be quite important; but the long-term instructional objective concerns the product of the finished essay. Figure 3.4 makes three important points about the role of instructional objectives in teaching-learning situations.

First, objectives establish direction, and when they are stated in terms of learning outcomes, they go beyond knowledge of the specific course content. Note the distinction between "study of" and "knowledge of" cell structures. The content (study of cell structure) is more aptly listed under process because it is the vehicle through which objectives (knowledge of parts of cell and so on) are attained.

Second, consider the varying degrees of dependence that the products ("knowledge," "skill," and "ability") have on the course content. "Knowledge of parts of cell" is the most closely related to the specific content of a biology course. "Skill in using microscope" and "ability to write accurate reports of scientific observations" relate to a greater variety of course content that could be used to achieve the same objectives.

The third point illustrated by the diagram is the degree to which objectives vary in complexity. The first learning outcome, "knowledge of parts of cell," is easily attained, and can be measured readily by a short-answer or fixed-response paper-and-pencil test. The last learning outcome, "ability to write accurate reports of scientific observations," is rather general, is unlikely to be attained completely in a single course, and requires judgmental analysis of student performances.

#### **FROM OVERLY SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES TOTHETHINKING CURRICULUM**

The predominant approach to the development and construction of tests from the 1920s through the 1980s relied on behavioral psychology. Behavioral psychology provided a framework to analyze learning outcomes in small steps and specific skills. Learning was conceptualized as being quite hierardlical, with higher-order skills dependent on a linear development based on a foundation of lower-level "essential skills. " This decomposition of desired outcomes into small steps allowed for a high degree of specificity of learning outcomes (for an elaboration of these points, see Shepard, 1991, 2000).

Highly specific objectives enabled the construction of precise test objectives. When coupled with the notion of linear learning hierardlies, specific objectives provided a natural basis for developing "criterion-referenced mastery tests." The behavioral objectives used to constmct mastery tests were typically concerned with relatively simple knowledge and skill outcomes. This made it possible to analyze each intended learning outcome in considerable detail and to describe the expected student pelformance in specific terms. The objective to "add whole numbers," for example , might be further defmed by a list of specific tasks SUdl as the following:

- Add two single-digit numbers with sums of 10 or less (2 + 5).
- Add two single-digit numbers with sums greater than 10 (6 + 8).
- Add three single-digit numbers with sums of 10 or less (2 + 4 + 3).
- Add three single-digit numbers with sums greater than 10 (7 + 5 + 9) .
- Add u.vo tT.vo-digit numbers without Cauytng (21 + 34).
- Add two two-digit numbers with simple carrying (36 + 27).
- Add two two-digit numbers with carrying into nine (57 + 48).
- Add two or more three-digit numbers with repeated carrying (687 + 839).

With mastery objectives such as these, it was frequently possible to specify a large representative sample of the specific responses expected of the students at the end of instniction. The learning tasks were then placed in sequential order so that they could be systematically taught and tested until mastery was adlieved, as shown in Figure 3.5. This procedure of stating specific tasks and then teaching and testing them one by one has been used in individualized instruction, in training programs, and in areas of dassroom inStniction that stress simple learning outcomes (e.g. , basic skills). The limited nature of the objectives and the detailed specification of the learning tasks enhance the use of criterion-referenced interpretation.

![](_page_61_Figure_13.jpeg)

Learning tasks is sequential order

Although this approach to test specification and construction continues to be used by some, the learning theory on which it is based has been strongly challenged in recent years by researchers focusing on learning and cognitive development. Cognitive researdl has discredited the notion that basic skills must be learned before higher-level thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving skills can be learned. According to cognitive research and theory, effective learning even at the most elementary levels of reading and mathematics requires the active involvement of students in constructing meaning by thinking and reasoning (for a more complete discussion, see Resnick & Resnick, 1992).

This cognitive research perspective of learning has several implications for assessment that have been explored in some detail in a report of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences (pellegrino, Chudowsky, & Glaser, 2001). First, the types of instructional objectives assodated with the perspective are concerned with the more complex learning outcomes (e.g., understanding, problem solving, reasoning, thinking skills, application to authentic problem situations outside of Sdl00l). Second, the perspective suggests the need for more comprehensive tasks that involve extended periods of time. Third, tasks need to be presented in a meaningful context; that is, they need to involve "authentic" problems.

Resnick and Resnick (1992) used an example from the assessment of writing to illustrate the distinction between the approaches to assessment that are compatible with the behavioral and cognitive perspectives. From either perspective, it could be readily agreed that the ability to edit one's own work is an important part of writing. An analysis of the spedfic skills involved might lead to the development of a test in w hich students were presented with written material and asked to identify errors and dl00se possible COiTectiOns. As Resnick and Resnick note, such a test might be useful for identifying copyediting skills but would not foster the sskills involved in writing and revising one's own work because it would not involve actual "crafting [of] plu'ases and sentences to convey intended meaning" (Resnick & Resnick, 1992, p. 6). Thus, the cognitive perspective leads to the use of written essays where students write rough drafts, review their dl'afts, and revise.

The cognitive research perspective also has implications for assessments in other content areas. In reading, it encourages the use of authentic texts (e.g., complete shOit stories or infonnational pieces) rather than the use of short segments consisting of a paragraph or two written specifically for the test. In mathematics, it encourages the application of problems with real-world content (e.g., the collection and analysis of data to determine the best location of a store). In science, it encourages the use of perfol1nance-based tasks involving active experimentation and analysis of results. In social studies, it encoumges the analysis of documents and the interpretation of historical events.

Shepard (2000) used an example problem of Thompson's (1995) to illustrate how even a simple mathematical question can probe a student's deep understanding of a concept. Thompson's illustrative problem was designed to assess understanding of simple fm.ctions by elementalY school dlildren. A figure displayed for the problem showed a rectangle divided into five segments of equal size. TluÂ·ee of the five segments were shaded. A u'aditional paper-and-pencil test might simply ask what fraction of the rectangle is shaded. Although a correct answer of three fifths would provide some information, it would not, by itself, give much of an indication that the student had deep understanding of fractions. Additional questions aJÂ·e needed to probe the depth of the student's understanding. As discussed by Shepard (2000), Thompson explored the depth of understanding by asking questions such as "Can you see three fifths of something? Can you see five d1irds of somed1ing? Can you

*see* five thirds of three fifths?" An affinnative answer to any question was followed by a request for the student to show or explain how the student sees the palticular quantity. Asking multiple questions on a single concept obviously is time consuming, particularly if the assessment is to cover a wide range of content in a short time, but such probing is necessary if the goal is the diagnosis of the depth of a student'S understanding of a concept.

The previous description identifies two ends of a continuum mnning from highly specific objectives (e.g., add two-digit integers or identify details that are explicitly stated in text) to mucl1 more general learning goals (e.g., relate physical materials and diagrams to mathematical ideas or read complicated text with understanding). Part of t11e debate about content standards is related to the location of standards between the two ends of this continuum. In practice, neither extreme is apt to be entirely satisfactory as a guide to the development or selection of assessments. The specific discrete skills end of t11e continuum leads to an overemphasis on disconnected, low-level skills and factual knowledge. The broad cognitive process end often remains at too general a level to provide adequate guidance for the development or selection of assessments that will have desirable measurement properties. Thus, in practice, an intermediate framework is needed to guide the development of assessments.

##### **Types of Learning Outcomes to Consider**

Although the cognitive researcl1 perspective is useful in forcing attention on broader educational goals that need to be addressed in the development or selection of an assessment, those general goals need to be supplemented by more systematic thinking about the types of learning outcomes that would provide evidence that the goals are being achieved. It is useful, for this reason, to classify learning outcomes under a few general headings. Any sllch classification is necessarily arbitrary, but it serves several useful purposes. It indicates types of learning outcomes that should be considered, it provides a framework for classifying those outcomes, and it directs attention toward changes in student performance in a variety of areas.

The following list of outcomes delineates the major areas in which instmctional objectives might be classified. The more specific areas under eacl1 type of outcome should not be regarded as exclUSive; t11ey are merely suggestive of categories to be considered. For a different set of categories, see the lists of outcomes in Appendix F.

##### **Taxonomy of Educational Objectives**

A useful guide for developing a comprehensive list of instructional objectives is the *Taxonomy of Educational Objectives.* This detailed classification of objectives is similar in form to the classification system used for plants and animals. It attempts to identify and classify all possible educational outcomes. The system first divides objectives into the following three major areas.

- 1. Cognitive Domain: Knowledge outcomes and intellectual abilities and skills
- 2. Affective Domain: Attitudes, interests, appredation, and modes of adjustment
- 3. Psychomotor Domain: Perceptual and motor skills

Each of the three domains is subdivided into categOlies and subcategories. The major categories in the cognitive domain, for example, are knowledge, comprehenSion, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. These categories begin with relatively simple knowledge outcomes and proceed through increasingly complex levels of intellectual ability. This pattern of classification is characteristic of all three domains.

The *Taxonomy* is primarily useful in identifying the types of learning outcomes that should be considered when developing a comprehensive list of objectives for classroom instruction. One need not use the terminology of the taxonomies when stating learning outcomes, but a review of the various taxonomy categories will aid in the development of a more complete list. The broad range of learning outcomes covered in the *Taxonomy* 

provides assurance that important types of learning are not overlooked. Appendix G provides a detailed summary of the Ta.xonomy categories and a list of the original sources from which the summaries were derived. In addition to detailed descriptions of the categories in eacll domain, illustrative instructional objectives from a variety of content areas are presented, as are lists of verbs that are useful in stating objectives for student performance.

##### GUIDELINES

Begin with a Simple Framework

Starting with a simple framework (Knowledge, Understanding, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation) will help move from factual information to more complex learning outcomes, as illustrated in the following examples.

- K = Knowledge
- U = Understanding
- Ap = Application
- An = Analysis
- S = Synthesis
- E = Evaluation

Each of these categories can be expanded with skills and affective outcomes as needed.

 Reading

- K: Knows vocabulary
- U: Reads with comprehension

##### Other Sources for Lists of Objectives

Illustrative instructional objectives for various grade levels and subject-matter areas may be obtained from the following sources.

1. Professional association standards: Although usually stated at a more general level than needed, the content standards of professional associations provide an excellent starting point for considering instructional objectives. A listing of some of the content standards of professional associations is provided in Appendix C.

2. State content standards: The content standards adopted by states also provide a good starting point for identifying instructional objectives. Although the content standards for the state or district in which a teacher is working obviously are most relevant, useful ideas may also be derived from standards of other states. For easy access to state content standards, see http://www.ccsso.org/projects/State\_Education\_Indicators/ Key\_State\_Education\_Policies/3160.cfm.

3. Methods books: Most books on methods of teaching discuss objectives, present examples, and cite references to other sources of objectives in various instructional areas.

4. Yearbooks and subject-matter standards publications of educational organizations: The yearbooks (and other publications dealing with subject-matter standards) of organizations such as the National Council of Teachers of English, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National Council for the Social Studies, and the National Science Teachers Association provide an excellent resource.

5. Encyclopedia of Educational Research: This publication typically contains an article on each major teaching area, which includes references to sources of instructional objectives.

6. Curriculum frameworks and guides: Many local and state curriculum frameworks or guides contain lists of instructional objectives.

7. Test manuals. The manuals accompanying published tests frequently contain lists of objectives that were used in constructing the tests.

8. Banks of objectives: Some organizations and test publishers maintain various banks of objectives and relevant test items. See Appendix C for addresses of some objectives banks.

In using content standards objectives from these various sources, it is important that the ones selected be relevant to the local instructional program. Content standards and selected objectives will most likely need to be reworded. Many of them will not be stated as intended learning outcomes or in performance terms. Published content standards and lists of objectives are probably most useful for obtaining ideas concerning possible outcomes and for assessing the completeness of a prepared list.

##### Criteria for Selecting Appropriate Objectives

Our emphasis throughout this section has been on the role of the classroom teacher in the process of selecting instructional objectives. We have deliberately avoided discussions concerning which objectives should receive priority at various grade levels and in various subject-matter areas. This is a decision for school boards, administrators, curriculum committees, and individual teachers. Our aim has been to clarify how to identify those instructional objectives that will be most useful for teaching and assessment purposes.

In preparing a list of instructional objectives for a particular course, the teacher faces the problem of determining the adequacy of the final list of objectives. The following questions will serve as criteria for this purpose (see Figure 3.6).

1. Do the objectives include aU important outcomes of the course? Knowledge objectives are seldom neglected. However, objectives in the area of understanding, application, thinking skills, attitudes, and the like tend to be slighted unless special efforts are made to consider them. Objectives derived mainly from the methocls of instruction and the sodal experiences of the students are also easily overlooked.

2. Are the objectives in harmony with the content standards of the state or district and with general goals of the school? Where states or districts have adopted content standards, the objectives developed by individual teacllers need to be consistent with those standards. The objectives developed by teachers must also be consistent with the general goals of the ScilOOI in which they are used. For example, a teacller of third-grade social studies in Virginia would want to take into account the statement of the standard shown in Figure 3.3 that students "will explain how the contributions of ancient Greece and Rome have influenced the present world in terms of architecture, government (direct and representative democracy), and sports." Similarly, if independent thought, self-direction, and effectiveness of communication are highly valued in the school, then these outcomes should be reflected in the teachers' objectives. Objectives inconsistent with these valued outcomes should be omitted from the list. Part of the difficulty of applying this cliterion is that the goals of the school are seldom explidtly stated .

3. Are the objectives in harmony with sound plinciples of learning? Because objectives indicate the desired outcomes of a series of learning experiences, they should be consistent with sound prindples of learning. That is, they should (a) be appropliate to the age level and experiential background of the students (prindple of readiness), (b) be related to the needs and interests of the students (prindple of motivation), (c) reflect learning outcomes that are most permanent (principle of retention), and (d) include learning outcomes that are most generally applicable to various specific situations (plinciple of transfer).

4. Are the objectives realistic in terms of the abilities of the students and the time and facilities available? First attempts at identifying objectives for a particular course frequently result in an impressive but unattainable list of outcomes. Thus, the final list of objectives should be reviewed in light of tlle students' developmental levels, their beginning skills and understandings, the time available for achieving the objectives, and the adequacy of the instructional resources and eqUipment available. It is usually better to have a limited set of clearly defined , attainable objectives than a long list of nonfunctional goals.

##### **Make Allowance for Unanticipated learning Outcomes**

No matter how carefully a set of instructional objectives has been selected for a course, there are likely to be some unanticipated effects of the instruction. These effects may be desirable or undesirable, and the majority of them are likely to fall into the affective area.

![](_page_68_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](_page_68_Figure_2.jpeg)

Summary of criteria for selecting the final list of objectives

For example, as a result of instruction, students may become more dependent or more independent, more confonning or more creative, more critical of printed material or less critical, more positive in their self-concept or more negative, and more interested in the subject or less interested. Outcomes of this nature are easily overlooked because they are more likely to result from the method of instruction than from the content of instruction.

In addition to these more global changes, specific classroom activities may create a need for focusing on outcomes that were not prespecified. An accident in the chemistry laboratolY, for example, may indicate a need for special instruction in safety. Similarly, an unantidpated student interest in the metric system may create a need to modify instruction in a mathematics class, or an unforeseen international crisis may alter social studies instruction. Thus, although instructional objectives provide a useful guide for instruction, tead1ers must be flexible enough in their teadling and testing to allow for unplanned events and unanticipated learning outcomes.

#### **METHOD OF STATING INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES**

In preparing a list of instructional objectives for a course of study, we have two immediate goals in mind. One is to create as complete a list of objectives as possible. This is most likely to occur if we follow the procedures for selecting objectives described in the previous section. The other goal is to state the objectives so that they dearly indicate the learning outcomes that we expect from our instruction.

The task of stating instructional objectives can be simplified if we constantly keep in mind that we are listing intended outcomes of teaching- learning situations. We are not describing what we intend to do during instruction but are listing tlle expected results of that instruction. The point of orientation, then, is the student and the types of performance

##### Stating Objectives as Learning Outcomes

Don't state objectives in tenns of the following:

- 1. Teacher perfonuance (e.g. , "Teach students key concepts. ")
- 2. Learning process (e.g., "Student learns meaning of concepts. ")
- 3. Course content (e.g., "Student studies geometric figures. ")
- 4. Two objectives (e.g. student knows and understand concepts)

State objectives in tenus of student performance or the end of instruction:

- 1. "Knows the meaning of concepts. "
	- 1.1 "Identifies a definition of the concept. "
	- 1.2 "Identifies the concept that fits a given description. "
	- 1.3 "Matches the concept to a picture" (e.g. , geometric figures).
	- 1.4 "Differentiates between the concept and a second concept. "
	- 1.5 "Applies the concept to an everyday situation."

that the student should demonstrate at the end of the teaching-learning experience. Stating objectives in terms of learning outcomes rather than the learning process is easier said than done. Most of us are so concerned with course content and the ongoing process in the classroom that we find it difficult to concentrate on the results of instruction. Although the very nature of teaching conditions us to focus our attention on the learning process, we can shift this focus if we continually ask ourselves, What should the students be able to do at the end of the course or unit of study that they could not do at the beginning? A;; we attempt to answer this question-always in terms of knowledge, understanding, skills, attitudes, and the like--we will find that the students' performance has, almost automatically, become the center of focus. We are then in a much better position to sta te our instructional objectives in terms of learning outcomes.

##### **How to Obtain a Clear Statement of Instructional Objectives**

A list of objectives for a course or unit of study should be detailed enough to convey the intent of the instruction yet general enough to serve as an effective overall guide in planning for teaching and assessment. You can do this most easily by defining your objectives in two steps: (1) stating the general objectives of instruction as intended learning outcomes, and (2) listing under each objective a sample of the specific types of perfOlmance that students should be able to demonstrate when they have achieved the objective (Gronlund, 2000). This procedure should result in statements of general objectives and specific learning outcomes such as the following:

- 1. Understands scientific principles
	- 1.1 Describes the principle in own words
	- 1.2 Identifies examples of the principle
	- 1.3 States tenable hypotheses based on the principle
	- 1.4 Uses the principle in solving novel problem
	- 1.5 Distinguishes between two given principles
	- 1.6 Explains the relationship between two given principles

The expected learning outcome is concerned with understanding, and the general objective starts right off with the verb *understands.* There is no need to add sucl1 repetitious material as "the students should be able to demonstrate that they understand." Keeping the statement free of unnecessalY words and stalting with a verb helps focus on the intended outcome.

There are several things to remember about the specific learning outcomes listed beneath the general objective. First, each statement begins with a verb. Here , however, the verbs are specific and indicate definite, observable responses, that is, ones that can be seen and assessed by an outside observer. These *verbs--describes, identifies, states, uses, distinguishes,* and e:xplain sta <sup>e</sup>specific learning outcomes in terms of observable student performance. See Appendix G for more verbs that state specific learning outcomes in the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor areas. Terms sllch as these clarify what the students will do to demonstrate their *understanding.* Vague terms, such as *realizes, sees,*  and *believes* are less useful in defining objectives because they describe internal states that can be expressed by various types of oven behavior.

Second, the list of specific learning outcomes is merely a sample of the many specific ways that an understanding of scientific principles might be shown. A student who

achieved this objective probably could demonstrate many other responses. Because it would be impractical to list all the specific types of performance that denote understanding, attempt to obtain a representative sample. This yields an operational definition of the general objective yet keeps the overall list of objectives and specific learning outcomes within manageable proportions.

Finally, note that the specific learning outcomes are free of specific course content. Rather than listing the scientific principles the students are to understand, they specify the types of student performance acceptable as evidence of understanding. Keeping the statements free of specific course content makes it possible to use the same list of learning outcomes with various units of study. Each unit of study will indicate the principles to be understood, and the list of specific learning outcomes will indicate how the students are expected to demonstrate their understanding. For example, if the unit were on force and motion, the previous list would be easily converted to that specific area science content (e.g. , understands principles of force and motion: describes the principles of force and motion in own words, identifies examples of the principles of force and motion, and so on). Once developed, the instructional objectives can be readily converted into a table of specifications for an assessment. As we will see in Chapter 6, a table of specifications also is a convenient means of relating the learning outcomes to the various content areas for assessment purposes.

##### **Stating the General Instructional Objectives**

One problem in stating the general instlUctional objectives is selecting the proper level of generallty. The objectives should be specific enough to provide direction for instruction but not so specific that instruction is reduced to training. When we state our major objectives in general terms, we provide for the integration of specific facts and skills into complex response patterns. General statements also give the teacher greater freedom in selecting the methods and materials of instruction. The "understanding of scientific principles," for example, may be adlieved through lecture, discussion, demonstration, group problem-solving activity, laboratory work, or some combination of these methods. Similarly, the objective may be achieved through the use of different textbooks or various other types of instructional material. Stating the general objectives at this level provides a focus for instruction but does not restrict the teadler to a particular instlUctional method or a given set of instructional materials.

The following list of general instlUctional objectives shows the desired level of generality.

- Knows basic terminology
- Understands concepts
- Relates concepts to everyday observations
- Applles principles to new situations
- Interprets graphs
- Sings independently, on pitch and in rhythm
- Demonstrates skill in critical thinking
- Formulates a position on an issue
- Writes a well-organized theme
- Converses in a second language (e.g. , Spanish)
- Appreciates poetry
- Demonstrates scientific attitude
- Evaluates an experiment's adequacy

The verbs at the beginning of each statement are general enough to encompass a range of specific learning outcomes. A sample of specific outcomes would need to be added before these general statements would be useful guides for teachlng and assessment. Note that each statement contains a single objective (e.g., 1Wt "Knows and understands") and that each statement is relatively free of course content.

The degree of generality may, of course, vary somewhat with the period of instl1lCtion for which the list is being prepared. The objectives for a brief unit of instruction are likely to be more specific than those for an entire course of study. In either case, however, selecting 8 to 12 general instructional objectives will usually provide a list that is both manageable and suitable.

##### **Stating the Specific learning Outcomes**

As stated earlier, each general instructional objective must be defined by a sample of specific learning outcomes to clarify how students can demonstrate that they have ad1ieved the general objective. Unless the general objectives are further defined in this manner, they will not provide adequate direction for teaching or assessment.

Statements of specific learning outcomes for a general objective will be easier to write and will more clearly convey instructional intent if each statement begins with an action verb that indicates definite, observable responses (e.g., *identifies, solves, communicates).* Such statements specify the types of student performance acceptable as evidence that the general instl1lctional objective has been achieved. This assumes, of course, that each specific learning outcome is directly relevant to the general objective it is defining. A statement such as "Writes the textbook definition of a principle" would be appropriate for listing under "Knows principles" but not under "Understands principles." For the latter objective, we would need a statement that goes beyond the recall of information because understanding implies some novelty in the response. Here, a statement such as "Explains the principle in own words" or "Applies the principle to solve an applied problem" would be more relevant.

A major problem in defining general instructional objectives is deciding how many specific learning outcomes to list under each objective. It is obvious that a fIXed number cannot be specified. Simple knowledge and skill outcomes typically reqUire fewer statements than complex ones. Because it is usually impossible or impractical to list all possible student responses for each general objective, the sample should be as representative as possible. In most cases there is not much advantage in listin more than seven or eight specific learning outcomes for each objective; four or five statements are probably more common. As a general guide, enough learning outcomes should be listed for each objective to show the typical performance of students who have satisfactorily achieved the objective.

The following general objectives and specific learning outcomes illustrate a satisfactory level of specificity for stating the intended learning outcomes.

- **1.** Understands the meaning of concepts
	- 1.1 Explains the concept in own words
	- 1.2 Identifies the meaning of a concept in context
- 1.3 Differentiates between proper and improper instances of a concept
- 1.4 Distinguishes between two similar concepts on the basis of meaning
- 1.5 Uses a concept to explain an everyday event
- 2. Demonstrates skill in critical thinking
	- 2.1 Distinguishes between fact and opinion
	- 2.2 Distinguishes between relevant and irrelevant information
	- 2.3 Identifies fallacious reasoning in written material
	- 2.4 Identifies the limitations of given data
	- 2.5 Formulates valid conclusions from given data
	- 2.6 Identifies the assumptions underlying conclusions

In addition to illustrating the desired degree of specificity, these statements are good examples of content-free objectives. As noted earlier, both the general objectives and the specific learning outcomes should be kept free of specific content so that they can be used with various units of study. In stating our specific learning outcomes, we are attempting to deso'ibe what types of student perfonnance represent each general objective-not what specific content the students are to learn.

Keeping the specific learning outcomes content free is, of course, a matter of degree. In some cases, all we can do is modify our statements so that they apply to a wider range of course material. The following statements illustrate ways to improve specific learning outcomes in this regard .

| EXAMPLF.S | Poor: Better: | Distinguishes between a square and a rectangle Distinguishes among geometric shapes                                                   |  |  |  |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|
|           | Poor: Better: | Identifies relevant historical antecedents of the Louisiana Purchase Identifies relevant historical antecedents of a historical event |  |  |  |
|           | Poor: Better: | Describes the main characters in Toni Morrison's Beloved Describes the main characters in the story                                   |  |  |  |

If we used the first version of each of these specific learning outcomes, we would have to write new statements for each identification, comparison, or deso'iption we wanted our students to make. The better versions can be llsed with various areas of content, thus freeing us from the repetitious writing of objectives as new subject matter is considered. SpecifiC learning outcomes should specify the *types ojreactions* the snldents are to make to the content, not identify the content itself.

In some cases, it may be desirable or necessalY to consult reference books and other relevant materials for the types of perfonnance that might represent an objective. When defining such complex outcomes as critical thinking, literary appreciation, and scientific attitude, for example, a review of the literature can be very useful. Although you may not find a detailed list of the specific components of each outcome , even general descriptions of the concepts will aid in defining relevant types of performance. In any event, resist the temptation to omit complex outcomes simply because they are difficult to define.

##### **Clarification** of Verbs **Used in Specific learning Outcomes**

Because the action verb is a key element in stating the specific learning outcomes, the selection and clarification of these verbs play an important role in obtaining a clearly defined set of instructional objectives. Ideally, we would like each verb (a) to convey clearly OUf instructional intent, and (b) to specify precisely the student pelformance we are willing to accept as evidence that the general objective has been attained. Some verbs convey instructional intent well (e.g. , *identifies);* others are more effective at specifying the student responses to be observed (e.g. , *labels, encircles, underlines).* When it is necessary to choose between these two types of verbs, it is best to select those that most clearly convey inst/uctionai intent and then, if necessary, clarify fUlther the expected student responses in one of the following ways.

- **1.** Add a third level of specificity to the list of objectives.
- 2. Define the action verbs used in the specific learning outcomes.
- 3. Use sample test items to illustrate the intended outcomes.

These procedures are probably most useful as guides to test construction and for communicating your intended learning outcomes to others.

The meaning of each specific learning outcome can be further clarified by listing tasks students are expected to perform to demonstrate achievement of the outcome. This would provide three levels for each instructional objective, as follows:

- **1.** Comprehends the meaning of written material
	- 1.1 Identifies the main thought in a passage 
	    - 1.1.1 Underlines the topic sentences\
		- 1.1.2 Selects the most appropriate title for the passage
		- 1.1.3 Writes the main theme of the passage

Adding the tl1ird level of specifiCity, might be useful for clarifying some learning outcomes. The specific tasks describe how students will indicate that they can "identify the main thought in a passage," but our intended outcome is still identifying the main thought. Underlining, selecting, and writing are simply responses we are willing to use as indicators of the "ability to identify." Thus, although the third level may be a desirable transition between specific learning outcomes and relevant test items, these specific responses are not instructional outcomes in tlleir own right (i.e., we are not interested in teaching students how to underline, select, and write but how to identify). This third level of specificity highlights one of the advantages of using levels of objectives rather than a list of specific tasks to describe tl1e intended outcomes of instruction. Witllievels, we are less likely to confuse 
the intended outcomes of instruction with indicators of those outcomes

##### **Summary of Steps for Stating Instructional Objectives**

The final list of objectives for a course or Lmit should include all impOltant learning outcomes (e.g. , knowledge, understanding, skills, attitude) and should clearly convey how students are expected to perform at the end of the learning experience. The following summary of steps (Gronlund, 2000) provides guidelines for obtaining a clear statement of instructional objectives.

- I. Stating the general instructional objectives
	- 1. State each general objective as an intended learning outcome (i.e., students' terminal performance).
	- 2. Begin each general objective with a verb (e.g., knows, applies, interprets). Omit "The student should be able to ... "
	- 3. State each general objective to include only one general learning outcome (e.g., not "Knows and understands").
	- 4. State each general objective at the proper level of generality (i.e., it should encompass a readily definable domain of responses). Eight to 12 general objectives will usually suffice.
	- 5. Keep each general objective sufficiently free of course content so that it can be used with various units of study.
	- 6. Minimize the overlap with other objectives.
- II. Stating the specific learning outcomes
	- 1. List beneath each general instructional objective a representative sample of specific learning outcomes that describe the terminal performance students are expected to demonstrate.
	- 2. Begin each specific learning outcome with an action verb that specifies observable performance (e.g., identifies, describes).
	- 3. Make sure that each specific learning outcome is relevant to the general objective it describes.
	- 4. Include enough specific learning outcomes to describe adequately the performance of students who have attained the objective.
	- 5. Keep the specific learning outcomes sufficiently free of course content so that the list can be used with various units of study.
	- 6. Consult reference materials for the specific components of those complex outcomes that are difficult to define (e.g., critical thinking, scientific attitude, creativity).
	- 7. Add a third level of specificity to the list of outcomes, if needed.

This procedure for stating objectives does not include the conditions under which the achievement of learning outcomes will be demonstrated (e.g., open book, diagrams will be provided) or the standards for evaluating performance (e.g., 90% correct). Although some teachers may want to add such information to each objective, there are advantages in stating the conditions and standards separately from the objectives. In many cases, the same conditions and standards apply to all objectives being assessed at a given time, and thus a statement such as the following may be sufficient for an entire set of objectives.

EXAMPI.E Student performance will be determined under closed-book conditions, but all needed formulas will be provided. Hand calculators may be used.

> A statement such as this will prevent the repetitious writing of the same conditions and standards for each objective and also avoid rewriting the list of objectives each time the conditions or standards are changed. We may, for example, use the same objectives

for different units of study (e.g., knows terms, understands principles, applies principles) but want to vary the conditions and standards to suit the nature and complexity of the material studied. We may also wish to modify the conditions or standards to match a particular group of students. Thus, limiting the statements of objectives to concise descriptions of desired student performance and stating the conditions and standards separately as needed seem to be desirable for most classroom instruction. The time saved from writing instructional objectives over and over can usually be well spent on other instructional activities.

#### SUMMARY

Instructional goals and objectives provide the foundation for both instruction and assessment of student learning. To achieve this purpose, they should not be so specific that they fractionalize learning and emphasize relatively simple knowledge and skill outcomes; nor should they be as broad and general as the goals described for state and national programs. For both instruction and assessment purposes, an intermediate framework is needed. We are describing one that is readily adaptable to the complex learning outcomes suggested by cognitive research.

Instructional objectives make clear what learning outcomes we expect from our teaching. They describe our instructional intent in terms of the types of performance students are expected to demonstrate as a result of instruction. A convenient means of preparing instructional objectives is to follow a two-step process: (1) State the general instructional objectives as intended learning outcomes, and (2) define each general objective with a list of specific learning outcomes that describe the observable responses the learners will be able to make when they have achieved the general objective.

When instructional objectives are viewed as learning outcomes and are defined in performance terms, numerous types of intended outcomes might be included. In addition to the more obvious knowledge outcomes, those in the areas of understanding, application, thinking skills, performance skills, attitudes, interests, appreciation, and adjustment should also be considered. Suggestions for objectives in these and other areas may be obtained from Appendix G, the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, content standards of professional associations, state and district content standards, various published sources, and objectives banks that have been prepared for national distribution. External sources should be used as aids only. Instructional objectives usually are most relevant when teachers develop their own lists, as these take into account the unique features of the local school and community.

The adequacy of the list of objectives for a particular course can be judged by the extent to which it (a) includes all important outcomes of the course, (b) is in harmony with state or district content standards, (c) is consistent with the school's general goals, (d) is in harmony with sound principles of learning, and (e) is realistic in terms of the students' abilities and the time and facilities available.

No matter how comprehensive a set of instructional objectives may be, there are likely to be some unanticipated outcomes of instruction. Thus, teachers be alert to this possibility during instruction and take these unplanned effects into account when assessing the learning outcomes of a course.

The task of stating instructional objectives is simplified if we keep in mind that we are making a list of intended outcomes of instruction, stated in terms of the types of pe!formance the students are expected to demonstrate at the end of the teaching-learning experience. The procedure for stating the objectives for a particular course includes the following steps.

- **1.** State each general instructional objective as an intended learning outcome that encompasses a readily definable domain of student responses. Eacl1 general objective should begin with a verb (e.g., *knows, understands, applies),* contain only one general learning outcome, and be relatively content free. Typically, 8 to 12 general objectives will suffice.
- **2.** List beneath each general instructional objective a representative sample of specific learning outcomes stated in terms of student performance. Each should begin with an action verb (e.g., *identifies, describes),* be relevant to the general objective, and be relatively free of course content so that it can be used with various units of study.

Instructional objectives will require the least rewriting and function most effectively if the conditions and standards of performance are stated separately.

### CHAPTER 4 :  VALIDITY

When constructing or selecting assessments, the most important questions are (a) to what extent will the interpretation of the scores be appropriate, meaningful, and useful for the intended application of the results? and (b) what are the consequences of the particular uses and interpretations that are made of the results? ursesmar

Assessments take a wide variety of forms, ranging from the familiar multiple-choice or other types of fixed-response tests to extended observations of performance. They also serve a variety of uses in the school. For example, assessment results might be used to identify student strengths and weaknesses, to plan instructional activities, or to communicate progress to students and parents; achievement tests might be used for selection, placement, diagnosis, or certification; aptitude tests might be used for predicting success in future learning activities or occupations; and appraisals of personal-social development might be used to better understand learning problems or to evaluate the effects of a particular school program. Regardless of the type of assessment used or how the results are to be used, all assessments should possess certain characteristics. The most essential of these are validity, reliability, and usability.

You may wonder why fairness is not listed. Fairness certainly is an essential characteristic of a good assessment. We did not list it separately, however, because fairness is an essential part of the comprehensive view of validity that is presented in this chapter.

Validity is the adequacy and appropriateness of the interpretations and uses of assessment results. Clearly, use of an assessment that leads to unfair treatment of girls, or African Americans, or English-language learners would not be evaluated as either adequate or appropriate. Nor would the use of assessment results to make unfair interpretations about the "capacity" of a group of students to learn be considered either adequate or appropriate. In both cases, the lack of fairness would lead to a negative evaluation of the validity of the interpretation or use of assessment results.

An evaluation of the validity of the use and interpretation of an assessment can take many forms. For example, if an assessment is to be used to describe student achievement, then we should like to be able to interpret the scores as a relevant and representative sample of the achievement domain to be measured. If the results are to be used as a measure of students' understanding of mathematical concepts, then we should like our interpretations to be based on evidence that the scores actually reflect mathematical understanding and are not distorted by irrelevant factors, such as the reading demands of the tasks. If the results are to be used to predict students' success in some future activity, then we should like our interpretations to be based on as good an estimate of future success as possible. Basically, then, validity is always concerned with the specific use of assessment results and the soundness and fairness of our proposed interpretations of those results. As we will see later in this chapter, however, this does not mean that validation procedures can be matched to specific assessment uses on a one-to-one basis.

In recent years, our understanding of validation has also come to include an evaluation of the adequacy and appropriateness of the uses that are made of assessment results. This expanded view of validity leads to a focus on the consequences of particular uses of assessment results. For example, if a state- or district-mandated test led teachers to ignore important content not covered by the test, then that consequence should be taken into account in judging the validity of the test use. In evaluating consequences it is important to distinguish between those consequences that are due to the assessment procedures and those that are the result of sodal or educational polides (Messick, 1994). Both are relevant to an evaluation of the use of the assessment, but it is consequences tied directly to characteristics of the assessment (e.g., an overemphasis on drill and practice, because the test places an undue emphasis on factual knowledge at the expense of conceptual understanding or problem-solving applications) that are the pri.malY concern in validation of a particular use of assessment

Reliability refers to the consistency of assessment results. If we obtain quite similar scores when the same assessment procedure is used with the same students on two different occasions, then we also can conclude that our results have a high degree of reliability from one occasion to another. Similarly, if different teachers independently rate student performances on the same assessment task and obtain similar ratings, we also can conclude that the results have a high degree of reliability from one rater to another. Like validity, reliability is intimately related to the type of interpretation to be made. For some uses, we may be interested in asking how reliable our assessment results are over a given period of time and, for others, how reliable they are over different samples of the same behavior. **In** all instances in which reliability is being determined, however, we are concerned with the *consistency* of the results rather than with the *appropriateness of the interpretations* made from the results (validity).

The relation between reliability and validity is sometimes confusing to persons who encounter these terms for the first time. Reliability (consistency) of measurement is needed to obtain valid results, but we can have reliability withollt validity. That is, we can have consistent measures that provide the wrong information or are interpreted inappropriately. The target-shooting illustration in Figure 4.1 depicts the concept that **reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity.** 

**In** addition to providing results that possess a satisfactOlY degree of validity and reliability, an assessment procedure must meet certain practical requirements. **It** should be economical from the viewpoint of both time and money, it should be easily administered and scored, and it should produce results that can be accurately interpreted and applied

 Figure 4.1

Reliability (consistency) is needed to obtain valid results (but one can be consistently "off target")

by available school personnel. These practical aspects of an assessment procedure all can be induded under the heading of usability. The term llsability, then, refers only to the *practicality* of the procedure and says nothing about the other qualities present.

#### **NATURE OF VALIDITY**

When using the term *validity* in relation to testing and assessment, keep the following cautions in mind.

1. Validity refers to the appropriateness of the interpretation and use made of the results of an assessment procedure for a given group of individuals, not to the procedure itself. We sometimes speak of the "validity of a test" for the sake of convenience, but it is more correct to speak of the validity of the interpretation and use to be made of the results.

2. Validity is a matter of degree; it does not exist on an all-or-none basis. Consequently, we should avoid thinking of assessment results as valid or invalid. Validity is best considered in terms of categories that specify degree, such as high validity, moderate validity, and low validity.

3. Validity is always specific to some particular use or interpretation for a specific population of test takers. No assessment is valid for *all* purposes. For example, the results of a mathematics test may have a high degree of validity for indicating computational skill, a low degree of validity for indicating mathematical reasoning, a moderate degree of validity for predicting success in future mathematics courses, and essentially no validity for predicting success in art or music. When indicating computational skill, the mathematics test may also have a high degree of validity for third- and fourth-grade students but a low degree of validity for second- or fifth-grade students. Thus, when appraising or describing validity,

it is necessaty to consider the specific interpretation or use to be made of the results. Assessment results are never just valid; they have a different degree of validity for each particular interpretation to be made.

**4.** Validity is a **unitary concept.** The conceptual nature of validity has typically been desaibed for the testing profession in a set of standards prepared by a joint committee of members from three professional organizations that are especially concemed with educational and psychological testing and assessment. In the two most recent revisions of the *Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing* by the American Educational Researcll Association CAERA), American PsycllOlogical Association (APA), and National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) (1999), the traditional view that there are several different types of validity has been discarded. Instead, validity is viewed as a unitalY concept based on various kinds of evidence. We will refer to the 1999 AERA, APA, NCME standards simply as the *Standards.* 

**5.** Validity involves an **overall evaluative judgment. It** requires an evaluation of the degree to whicll interpretations and uses of assessment results are justified by suppolting evidence and in terms of the consequences of those interpretations and uses.

There are many ways of accumulating evidence to support or challenge the validity of an interpretation or use of assessment results. The *Standards* discuss five sources of evidence that are proposed for possible use in evaluating the validity of a specific use or interpretation. These sources of evidence are based on (a) test content, (b) response processes, (c) internal structure, Cd) relations to other variables, and (e) consequences of testing. Thus, validation may include a consideration of the content measured, the ways in which students respond, the relationship of individual items to the test scores, the reltionship od performance to other assessments and the consequences of using and interpreting assessment results.

Traditionally, the ways of accumulating evidence have been grouped together in one of three categories (content-related, construct-related, and criterion-related evidence). Each type of evidence is an important consideration in arriving at an overall evaluation of the degree of validity of any given interpretation of scores on a test or other assessment procedure. Although the traditional methods of accumulating evidence include the first four sources of evidence in the *Standards* (mostly under the broad umbrella of construct validity), these traditional categories do not take into account that the consequences of uses and the interpretation of assessment results also influence validity. Hence, we will discuss four intenÂ·elated considerations----content, construct, assessment-criterion relationships, and consequences--in the evaluation of validity rather than a list of distinct validation methods.

#### **MAJOR CONSIDERATIONS IN ASSESSMENT VALIDATION**

Four major considerations for validation are briefly described in Table 4.1. The strongest case for validity can be made when evidence is obtained regarding all four considerations herein. That is, interpretations and lIses of assessment results are likely to have greater validity when we have an understanding of (a) the assessment content and the specifications from which it was derived, (b) the nature of the characteristic(s) being measured, (c) the

relation of the assessment results to other significant measures, and (d) the consequences of the uses and interpretations of the results. However, for many uses of a test or an assessment, it is not practical or necessary to have evidence dealing with all four considerations. For example, it is not practical to expect that a teacher would provide evidence that a classroom assessment designed to measure student learning is related to other significant measures. In this case, the pIimary concern would be content, but some of the analyses of the meaning of the scores (construct considerations) and possible effects on student motivation and learning (consequence considerations) would be relevant.

imilarly, in using a scholastic aptitude test to predict future success in school, testcliterion relationships would be of major interest; but we would also be concerned about the appropliateness of the content, possible irrelevant factors (not part of the oonstruct) that influence test performance (e.g., motivation, test anxiety, test-taking skills), and possible unintended oonsequences of using predictions. Thus, content, construct, and consequence considerations would be relevant. One consideration is likely to be of primalY importance, but the other three are useful for a fuller understanding of the meaning of the assessment results and, therefore, contribute to the validation of our interpretations.

Although many o ther considerations are relevant to validity, our discussions of content, construct, assessment-criterion relationships, and consequence considerations will focus on those procedures that are most useful in practical educational settings.

#### **CONTENT CONSIDERATIONS**

Content considerations are of special importance when we wish to describe how an individual performs on a domain of tasks that the assessment is supposed to represent. We may, for example, eA'Pect students to be able to spell the 200 words on a given list. Because a 200-word spe1l1ng test is too time consuming, we may select a sample of 20 words to represent the total domain of 200 spe1l1ng words. If Margaret con-ectly spells 80% of these 20 words, we would like to be able to say that she can probably spell approximately 80% of the 200 words. Thus, we would like to be able to generalize from the student's perfoO"l1ance on the sample of words in the test to the performance that tile student would be expected to demonstrate on tile domain of spelling words that tile test represents.

The validity of tile interpretation, in which a test score implies that tile student can probably spell a given percentage of words in the whole domain, depends on considerations that go beyond the question of content. For example, construct considerations, such as the assumption that Margaret was ttying to do her best, that she did not copy her neighbor's spelling words, and that she understood the teadler's pronunciation of the words, influence the validity of the interpretation that can spell a given fraction of the worda. Here however, our concern is with the extent to which our 2Q-word test constituted a representative sample of the 200 words. In this instance, we can obtain a fairly representative sample of spelling words by simply stalting with our 200-word list and selecting eVeJY 10th word. Having thus assured ourselves tllat we have a reasonably representative sample, we would have good support for tile desired interpretation, in terms of content considerations. As we will see shortly, judging how adequately an assessment samples a given domain of adlievement is usually much more complex man in tllis simple example, particularly when me learning outcomes involve more complex understandings or integrated performances.

The essence of tile content consideration in validation, men, is determining the adequacy of the sampling of the content mat the assessment results are interpreted to represent. More formally, **the goal in the consideration of content validation is to determine the extent to which a set of assessment tasks provides a relevant and representative sample of the domain of tasks about wWch interpretations of assessment results are made.** Focusing only on the issue of the adequacy of tile sample from a content domain, of course, begs the question of priorities mat should be given to different aspects of the content domain to be assessed. The definition of the domain to be assessed should derive directly from the identification of goals and objectives as discllssed in Chapter 3. Emphasized in tile quotes in the box "Defining tl1e Content Domain of an Assessment," it is critical tllat the assessment begin with a content domain that reflects the important goals and objectives.

In classroom assessment, the domains of achieveJuent tasks are deteO"l1ined byapplicable content standards, the curriculum, and instt"Uction. Assessment development involves (a) dearly specifying me domain of instmctionally relevant tasks to be used to measure

![](_page_85_Figure_1.jpeg)

student achievement, (b) specifying the emphasis or relative importance according to the priority of goals and objectives, and (c) constructing or selecting a representative set of assessment tasks. Thus, to obtain a valid measure of learning outcomes, we proceed from the instruction (what has been taught) to the achievement domain (what is to be measured) to the priorities for measurement (what should be emphasized in the assessment) and finally to the assessment itself (a representative sample of relevant tasks). As shown in Figure 4.2 content considerations in validation require a judgment that all four are in close hannony.

Rigorous judgments regarding va lidity based on content considerations should not be confused with face validity, which refers only to the appearance of the assessment. Based on a superficial examination of the tasks, does the assessment appear to be a reasonable measure? A simple example can be used to draw a clear distinction between making validity ciaims based on rigorous consideration of content definitions and the adequacy of sampling of tasks and making claims based on face va lidity (Le. , on the basis of appearance). On an arithmetic test to a young child, we might ptu'ase an item as follows: "If you had a 10-foot piece of *string* and you cut it in half, how long would the two pieces be?" If the test was to be given to carpenters, we would substitute the word *board* for *string* in this item. Similarly, for plumbers we would use the word *pipe* and for electricians the word wire. The problem remains the same, but by phrasing it in appropriate terms, it appears more relevant to the test taker (Le. , it has greater face validity). The validity of interpretations of the arithmetic test scores would not be detennined by how the test

##### Defining the Content Domain of an Assessment

"Assessment activities should contribute to instructional improvement by focusing on instruction targets that are consistent with the goals of instructional activities" (Linn & Baker, 1996).

Science Standards: "Achievement data collected focus on the science content that is most important for students to learn"

(National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment, National Research Council, 1995, p. 79).

Mathematics Standards: "The mathematics standard: Assessment should reflect the mathematics that all students need to know and be able to do" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1995, p. 11).

looked, however, but by how well it sampled the domain of arithmetic tasks important to each group (i.e., children, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians). Thus, our arithmetic test may provide an adequate measure of content for one group but not another, even though the items were phrased in terms appropriate to each group. Although a test should look like an appropriate measure to obtain the cooperation of those taking the test, face validity should not be considered a substitute for more rigorous evaluation of content definitions and sampling adequacy.

##### Content Considerations in Assessment Development to Enhance Validity

Content issues are typically considered during the development of an assessment. It is primarily a matter of preparing detailed specifications and then constructing an assessment that meets these specifications. Although there are many ways of specifying what an assessment should measure, one widely used procedure in constructing achievement tests uses a two-way chart called a table of specifications. We will use a brief form of it here to help clarify the process of content validation in preparing classroom assessments. More elaborate tables of specifications and other types of specifications will be described and illustrated in Chapter 6.

Table of Specifications. The learning outcomes of a course or curriculum may be broadly defined to include both subject-matter content and instructional objectives. The former is concerned with the topics to be learned and the latter with the types of performance students are expected to demonstrate (e.g., knows, comprehends, applies, analyzes, synthesizes, evaluates). Both of these aspects are of concern in defining content domain and ensuring adequate sampling from it. We should like any assessment of achievement that we construct to produce results that represent both the content areas and the objectives we wish to measure, and the table of specifications aids in obtaining a sample of tasks that represents both.

A table of specifications, in a very simple form, is presented in Table 4.2 to show how such a table is used in test development. The percentages in the table indicate the relative degree of emphasis that each content area and each instructional objective is to be given in the test. Thus, if a 50-item classroom test is to measure a representative

sample of subject-matter content, then 22% of the items (i.e., 11 items) should be concerned with air pressure, 20% with air temperature, 16% with humidity and precipitation, 16% with the wind, 14% with the clouds, and 12% with fronts. Similarly, if the test is to measure a representative sample of the instructional objectives, then 12% of the items (i.e., 6 items) should measure knowledge of concepts, 24% should measure comprehension of concepts, 16% should measure application of concepts, 16% should measure analysis of concepts, 20% should measure synthesis of concepts, and 12% should measure evaluation of concepts. Thus, 52% of the items should measure the three lowest levels of Bloom's taxonomy and 48% of the items should measure the three highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy. This, of course, implies that the emphasis on knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation for each content area will follow the percentages in the table of specifications. For example, 2% of the test items (i.e., a single item) concerned should measure knowledge of air pressure concepts, 4% should measure comprehension of air pressure concepts, 4% should measure application of air pressure concepts, 6% should measure analysis of air pressure concepts, 4% should measure synthesis of air pressure concepts, and 2% should measure evaluation of air pressure concepts.

As noted earlier, the specifications describing the achievement domain to be measured should be in harmony with what was taught. Thus, the weights assigned in this table reflect the emphasis that was given during instruction. For example, comprehension outcomes received more emphasis than either knowledge or application outcomes in the instruction, and synthesis outcomes received more emphasis than either analysis or evaluation outcomes. The weights assigned through the table show that 44% of the instruction should emphasize comprehension and synthesis. The table, then, indicates the sample of instructionally relevant learning tasks to be measured, and the more closely the test items correspond to the specified sample, the greater the likelihood of obtaining a valid measure of student learning.

The test items and other kinds of assessment tasks must function as intended if valid results are to be obtained. Test items and assessment tasks may function improperly if they contain inappropriate vocabulaIY, unclear directions, or some other defect. Similarly, tasks designed to measure comprehension and synthesis may measure only the simple recall of infonnation if the solutions to the problems have been directly taught during instmction. In shott, a host of factors can influence the intended function of the tasks and thus the validity of the assessment results. Much of what is written in this book concerning tlle construction of classroom assessments is directed toward producing valid measures of achievement.

##### **Content Considerations in Test Selection**

Evidence obtained from an analysis of content domain definition and content coverage (sampling adequacy) is also of concern when selecting published achievement tests. When test publishers prepare achievement tests for use in the schools, they pay special attention to content. Their test specifications, however, are based on what is commonly taught in many different schools. Thus, a published test mayor may not fit a panicular scllool situation. To determine whether it does, it is necessary to go beyond the title of the test and examine what the test actually measures. A careful consideration of what the test measures is a necessaIY step in adopting any test, because tlle *Standards* make it clear that the ultimate responsibility for test use and interpretation lies with the user (e.g., local educator) railier than the publisher. Thus, it is important to ask questions such as the following: How well is the test content aligned. with the state or district content standards? How closely does ilie test content correspond to the course content and ilie clllTiculum and instmctional goals in the local instmctional prograIU? Does the test provide a balanced measure of the intended learning outcomes? Are the most impottant objectives emphasized appropriately, or are some areas overemphasized and others neglected? A published test may provide more valid results for one school program than for another, depending on how closely the set of test tasks matches the achievement to be measured.

The same types of specifications used in preparing classroom assessments can be used in selecting published tests. The detailed descriptions of course content and instructional objectives and ilie relative emphasis to be given to eacll can help us detennine which of several published tests is most relevant to our particular situation. It is simply a matter of examining the items in each test and comparing them to our test specifications. The test that provides the most balanced measure of the specified achievement domain is the one that will produce the most valid results. Many test publishers include a detailed description of their test specifications in the test manual. Although this makes it easier to judge the potential validity of tlle test results, there is no substitute for examining the test tasks themseives and judging how vaiidjy they measure the intended iearning outcomes in the iocai instmctional program.

##### **Content Considerations in** *Other* **Areas**

AltllOugh content considerations are of prU11ll1Y interest in assessing aci1ievement, tlley are also of interest in oilier areas. For example, examining the content of a scllolastic aptitude test aids in understanding tlle meaning of ilie scores and provides some evidence concerning the types of prediction for which it might be best suited. Similarly, when constmcting or selecting an attitude scale, we are interested in how adequately the items cover those attitudinal topics included in the domain to be measured. In the same manner, an interest inventory should include samples of items that adequately represent those aspects of interest we wish to measure. **In** these and other situations, the content validation procedure is essentially the same as that in testing and assessment of achievement. It is a matter of analyzing the content and tasks included in the measuring instrument and the domain of outcomes to be measured and judging the degree of cOITespondence between them.

#### **CONSTRUCT CONSIDERATIONS**

Although we are considering them second, most measurement spedalists would give highest prioIity to construct considerations in evaluating the validity of an interpretation or use of an assessment. We began with content oonsiderations because the review of the content domain and sampling helps us detem1ine how well test or assessment scores represent a given domain of tasks and is espedally useful in both the preparation and the evaluation of all types of assessment of achievement. However, because we usually wish to interpret test and assessment results in terms of more general individual cl1aracteristics (e.g. reading comprehension, communication ability, understanding of scientific plincipies), we need to consider the conSU'llct that the assessment is intended to measure. These characteristics may be labeled in a variety of ways (e.g., skills, accomplishments, abilities, psychological traits, personal qualities), but regardless of the label, they involve some inference about a constHiCt that goes beyond the factual statement that a student obtained a given score ona particuar test or assessment. For example rather than only stating that a student cOITectly solved 75% of the tasks on a particular mathematics test, we might want to infer that the student possesses a certain degree of mathematical reasoning ability. This provides a broad general description of student performance that has implications for many different uses.

Whenever we wish to interpret assessment results in tem1S of some individual characteristic (e.g., reading comprehension, mathematics problem-solving ability), we are concerned with a construct. A construct is an individual cl1aracteristic that we assume exists in order to explain some aspect of behavior. Mathematical reasoning is a construct, and so are reading comprehension, understanding of tlle principles of electricity, intelligence, creativity, and such personality characteIistics as sodability, honesty, and anxiety. These are called constructs because they are tlleoretical constructions that are used to e:ll..'Plain performance on an assessment. When we interpret assessment results as a measure of a palticular construct, we are implying that there is such a construct, that it differs from otller constructs, and that the results provide a measure of the construd that is little influenced by extraneous factors. Verifying such implications is the task of construct validation.

Construct validation may be defined as tlle process of determining the extent to which performance on an assessment can be interpreted in terms of one or more constructs. Although construct validation has been commonly associated with theory building and theory testing (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955), it also has implications for the practical use of assessment results. Whenever an assessment is to be interpreted as a measure of a particular constI'llct, tl1e various types of evidence useful for construct validation should be considered during its development or selection. This will almost celtainly include

consideration of content and may include consideration of assessment--criterion relationships, but a variety of other types of evidence is also relevant. The most appropriate types of evidence will be dictated by the particular construct to be measured.

Two questions are central to any construct validation: (1) Does the assessment adequately represent the intended construct? and (2) is performance influenced by factors that are ancillary or irrelevant to the construct? In the jargon of measurement specialists, these two questions are concerned with construct underrepresentation and construct-irrelevant variance. Both are stated in the negative. That is, validity is reduced to the degree that important aspects of the construct are underrepresented in the assessment. Validity is also reduced to the degree that performance is influenced by irrelevant factors such as skills that are ancillaty to the intent of the assessment (e.g., reading speed on a reading comprehension test or punctuation on a test of understanding scientific principles).

Construct-inÂ·elevant factors can lead to unfairness in the use and interpretation of assessment results. An assessment intended to measure understanding of mathematical concepts, for example, could lead to unfair inferences about the level of understanding of English-language learners because of the heavy reading demands of the assessment tasks, which are presented only in English.

In Chapter 3, a standard from the Colorado geography content standards was used. as an illustration of state content standards. It will be repeated here to illustrate the important ideas of construct underrepresentation and construct-irrelevant variance. The standard is as follows:

Students understand how economic, political, cultural, and social processes interact to shape patterns of human populations, interdependence, cooperation, and conflict. *(Colorado Model Content Standards for Geography,* Colorado Depaltment of Education; adopted June 1995, amended November 1995)

The validity of an assessment of this standard would be undermined. by construct underrepresentation if it dealt only with economic and political processes and their interactions. The cultural and social processes would be underrepresented (or not represented at all). The validity of the assessment would also be called into question because of constructirrelevant variance if it were found that the major factors influencing student scores on the assessment were writing mecllanics (e.g. grammar, punctuation, and spelling) of the essays written in response to the tasks. Although writing mechanics are skills that a teacher might want to assess, those skills are ancillary to determining whether a student has acquired the understanding that is the intent of the illustrative geography standard.

Although construct validation is often associated with tests and assessments used to measure theoretical psychological constructs such as anxiety or introversion, it should be clear from the previous example that considerations of construct underrepresentation and construct-irrelevant variance are equally applicable to both published and teacherdeveloped assessments used in the classroom.

Some aspects of construct undenÂ·epresentation were dealt with directly when considering the content basis of validity. For example, the validity assessment of a unit on weather that was supposed to be aligned with the table of specifications shown in Table 4.2 would be called into question if there were no tasks that required knowledge or understanding of clouds or if none of the higher cognitive levels (e.g., synthesis and evaluation) were needed to complete the unit. Construct considerations, however, also involve questions about

student characteristics, such as understanding or problem-solving ability. This requires considering the possibility that a correct answer might simply reflect recall of an answer from a textbook or going through the motions of applying an algorithm to a problem rather than real understanding or problem-solving ability--both of which may require that the task be novel to the student.

In considering constmct-irrelevant factors may undermine validity, it is useful to think about ancillary skills that may have an impact on pelfonnance on the assessment. On an assessment in mathematics or science, for example, reading ability is one obvious skill that may be andllary to the intent of the assessment. Thus, it would be important to review the reading demands of the tasks to ensure that perfonnance of some students was limited not by a lack of understanding of science principles or mathematical concepts but by reading difficulties. Such a review is likely to be particularly important for assessments involving English-language learners.

A wide range of construct-inÂ·elevant factors may undermine validity. **In** addition to the influence of ancillary skills (e.g., reading on a science test), the test can interact with student characteristics such as test-wiseness, motivation, or anxiety. As a consequence, students who have low test-wiseness (or low motivation or high anxiety) might be expected to score lower that their true ability would indicate on a science test. Instruction can also introduce constmct irrelevant factors when comparing two groups of students who have not had an equal opportunity to learn the material. For example, if one group of students has received instmction that emphasizes higher-order skills and another group of students received instruction that emphasized lower-level skills, then comparisons of the students' abilities on a test that measures higher-order skills would not lead to reasonable interpretations. In short anything that affects perfomance on the assessment that is not the construct of interest introduces a potential source of constmct-irrelevance or invalidity.

Constmct validation takes place primarily during the development and tlyout of a test or an assessment and is based on an accumulation of evidence from varied sources. When selecting a published test that presumably measures a particular constmct, such as mathematical reasoning or reading comprehension, the test manual should be examined to determine what evidence is presented to SUPPOlt the validity of the proposed interpretations.

An illustration of some types of evidence that might be used in the constmct validation of an assessment of mathematical reasoning is shown in Figure 4.3. Although other types of studies could be added, this listing is sufficient to clarify the variety of types of evidence needed to SUPPOlt the claim that the assessment scores can be interpreted as measures of mathematical reasoning. Notice that considerations of both content and assessment-criterion relationships (considered in greater deta.i\ in the next section of tlus chapter) are included, along with other comparisons and cOITelations. No single type of evidence is suffident, bur the accumulation of various types of evidence helps describe what the assessment measures and how the scores relate to other significant variables. This clarifies the meaning of the assessment pelformance and aids in determining how vaHclIy mathematical reasoning is being measured.

In theory bUilding and theory testing, the accumulation of evidence for constmct validation may be endless. As new data are gathered, both the theory and the test or assessment are likely to be modified, and the testing of hypotheses continues. For the practical

 Figure 4.3

Types of evidence used in construct validation

use of test and assessment results, however, we need to employ a more restricted framework when considering constmct validation. During the development and selection of tests and assessments, o ur focus should be on the types of evidence that it seems reasonable to obtain, giving special attention to those data that are most relevant to the types of interpretations to be made. We can thus increase our understanding of what the assessment measures and how validly it does so without becoming involved in an *endless* task of data gathering.

##### **Methods Used in Construct Validation**

ConstlUct validation depends on logical inferences drawn from a variety of types of data. As noted earlier, analyses of content and criterion relationships provide paltial support for our interpretations, but this must be supplemented by various SUI dies that further clarify the meaning of the assessment results. Although it is impossible to describe all the specific procedures that might be used in constlUct validation, the following exemplify some of the more commonly used methods.

1. Defining the domain or tasks to be measured. The specifications should be so well defined that the meaning of the construct is clear and it is possible to judge the extent to which the assessment provides a relevant and representative measure of the task domain. If a single construct is being measured, then the tasks should evoke similar types of responses and be highly interrelated (also a content consideration).

2. Analyzing the response process required by the assessment tasks. The response process called forth by the assessment tasks can be determined both by examining the test tasks themselves and by administering the tasks to individual students and having them "think aloud" as they perform the tasks. Thus, examination of the items in a reading comprehension test may indicate that literal comprehension is emphasized, with relatively few items devoted to inferential comprehension. Similarly, a review of the requirements for performance of a laboratory task in science may reveal a substantial emphasis on accurate recording of results but too little emphasis on the conceptual integration of the laboratOlY results with tlleolY or eVeJyday experiences. Such judgments can be checi(ed by administering tlle tasks to individual sUldents and having them explain how they obtain their res-ponses. In the example in Figure 4. 3, "thinking aloud" may verify that the tasks call for the intended reasoning process, or it may reveal tllat most problems can be solved by a simple trial-and-error procedure.

3. Comparing the scores of known groups. In some cases, it is possible to predict that scores will differ from one group to another. These may be age groups, trained and untrained, adjusted and maladjusted, and the Ii!(e. For example, level of adlievement generally ina'eases with age (at least during dlildhood and adolescence). Also, it is reasonable to expect that performance on an assessment will differ for groups that have received different amounts of instruction in the subject matter of the assessment and that scores on adjustment inventories will discriminate between groups of adjusted and maladjusted individuals. TI1US, a prediction of differences for a particular test or assessment can be checked against groups that are known to differ and the results used as pattial support for construct validation.

4. Comparing scores before and after a particular learning experience or experimental treatment. We would like our assessments to be sensitive to some types of expeliences and insensitive to others. Celtainly, we would li!(e assessments of sUldent achievement in a given subject-matter area to improve during the course of instlUction. On the other hand, we would not Ii!(e them to be influenced by SUdl factors as student anXiety. TIlliS, both a demonstration of increases in performance follOWing instlUction and a demonstration that performance was affected little by a treatment designed to reduce sUldent anxiety would lend SUppOit to the construct validity of the assessment.

; . Correlating the scores with other measures. The scores of any particular assessment can be expected to correlate substantially with the scores of other measures of the same or a similar construct. (See the next section of this chapter and Appendix A for a discussion of correlation.) By the same token, lower correlations would be expected to be obtained with measures of a different ability or trait. For example, we would expect rather high con-eJation between two scholastic aptitude tests but mudl lower correlation between a scholastic and a musical aptitude test. Similarly, we would expect student pelformances on two assessments of writing to have substantially higher correlations with each other than either would have with an assessment in mathematics. Thus, for any given test or assessment, we would predict higher correlations with like tests and assessments and lower correlations with unlike tests and assessments. In addition, we might also predict that the assessment scores would correlate with vatious practical clitet1a. Sd10lastic aptitude scores, for example, should conÂ·elate satisfactorily with school grades, scores on performance in chemistry, and other measures of adlievement in dlemistry. This latter type of evidence is obtained by snldies of assessment-criterion relationships. Our interest here, however, is not in the immediate problem of prediction, but in using these correlations to support the daim that the test measures sdl0lastic aptinlde or that the assessment measures understanding of chemical prindples. As indicated earlier, construct validation depends on a wide array of eVidence, induding that proVided by the other validation procedures.

Broadly conceived, construct validation is an attempt to account for the differences in assessment results. During the development of an assessment, an attempt is made to rule out extraneous factors that might distOlt the meaning of the scores, and follow-up studies are conducted to verify the success of these attempts. The aim is to darify the meaning of student performance by identifying the nature and strength of all factors influendng the scores on the assessment.

Construct validation is important to all types of testing and assessment-achievement, aptinlde, and personal-social development. Whether constructing or selecting an assessment, the meaning of the resulting scores depends on the care with which the assessment was constructed and the array of evidence supporting the types of interpretations to be made. Construct validation is emphasized in most recent discussions of validity in the tedlmcal and theoretical literature, in part because, as we have seen, it subsumes considerations of content and criterion relationships and in part because meaning is crucial in our uses and interpretations of the scores. The latter point was stressed by Messick (1989), who stated, "The meaning of the measure, and hence its construct validity, must always be pursued-not only to support test interpretation but also to justify test use" (p. 17).

#### **ASSESSMENT -CRITERION RE lATI ONSH IPS**

Although few teachers will conduct studies relating assessment results to other measures it is important to understand the use of assessment-criterion relationships in evaluating validity. Understanding how assessment-criterion relationships are analyzed, for example, will help in evaluating the use of standardized tests to make predictions of student perfonnance in other settings.

When test scores are to be used to predict future pelformance or to estimate cunent perfonnance on some valued measure other than the test itself (called a cliterion), we are especially concerned with evaluating the relationship between the test and the criterion. For example, reading readiness test scores might be used to predict students' future achievement in reading, or a test of dictionary skills might be used to estimate students' current skills in the actual use of the dictionary (as detennined by observation). In the first example, we are interested in prediction and thus in the relationship between the two measures over time. This procedure for obtaining evidence of validity calls for a predictive validation study. In the second example, we are attempting to estimate present status, and thus we are interested in the relationship between two measures obtained concunently. A high relationship in t11is case would show that the test of dictionary skills is a good indicator of actual skill in using a dictionalY. This procedure for obtaining evidence of validity calls for a concurrent validation study. Both the predictive and the concurrent designs are subsumed under the more general category of criterion-related validation because t11e method of determining and expressing validity is t11e same in both cases. The major difference resides in the time period between the two obtained measures, as illustrated in Figure 4.4.

The focus of both types of studies shown in Figure 4.4 is on detennining t11e extent to which test performance is related to some otl1er valued measure of pelformance. As noted earlier, the second measure of performance (called a criterion) may be obtained at some future date (when we are interested in predicting future performance) or concurrently (when we are interested in estimating present performance). First, let llS examine the use of testcriterion relationships from t11e standpoint of predicting success in some future activity.

##### **Predicting Future Performance**

Suppose that Mr. Tanaka, a junior high school teacher, wants to determine how well the scores from a scholastic aptitude test will predict success in his seventh-grade mathematics class. Because the scholastic aptitude test is administered to all students when they enter junior high school, these scores are readily available to !vir. Tanaka. His biggest problem is deciding on a criterion of successful achievement in mathematics. For lack of a better criterion, he decides to use a comprehensive departmental examination that is administered to aU seventh-grade math sections at the end of the school year. It is now possible for Mr. Tanaka to determine how well the scholastic aptitude test scores predict success in his mathematics class by comparing the students' scholastic aptitude test scores with their scores on the departmental examination. Do those students who have high scholastic aptitude test scores also tend to have high scores on the departmental examination? Do those who have low scholastic aptitude test scores also tend to have low scores on the departmental examination? If this is the case, Mr. Tanaka is inclined to agree that the scholastic aptitude test scores tend to be reasonably accurate in predicting achievement in this mathematics class.

In our example, Mr. Tanaka merely inspected the scholastic aptitude and achievement test scores to detennine the agreement between them. Although this may be a desirable preliminary step, it does not provide a precise notion of the degree of relationship between the aptitude test scores and the scores on the comprehensive departmental examination, nor does it provide a good way of communicating the results. The degree of relationship can be deso'ibed more precisely by statistically correlating the two sets of scores. The resulting correlation coefficient provides a numerical summary of the degree of relationship between the two sets of scores. A correlation coefficient provides a concise, quantitative summary of the relationship for anyone who has learned to understand and interpret this statistical measure. Scores on the scholastic aptitude test also can be converted to predicted achievement scores by means of a regression equation.

Communication of the meaning of the relationship also can be facilitated by the use of a graphical presentation of the results in the form of a scatter plot or by the use of an expectancy table. The construction of scatter plots (also known as scattergrams or scatter diagrams) and the calculation and interpretation of correlation coefficients and regression equations are described and illustrated in Appendix A. In this chapter, we confine our discussion to the use and interpretation of these indicators of relationship within the context of criterion-related validation. The construction and interpretation of expectancy tables and regression equations also will be described here.

##### **Correlation**

To illustrate the use of correlation coeffidents and scatter plots in studies of test--criterion relationships, let us consider the exact scores that Mr. Tanaka's students received on both the scholastic aptitude test (predictor) and the departmental examination in mathematics (criterion). This information is provided in the first two columns of Table 4.3. By inspecting these two columns of scores, we see that the high scores in column 1 tend to match the high scores in column 2. This comparison is difficult to make, however, because the sizes of the test scores in the two columns are different.

The agreement of the two sets of scores can be more easily seen if the test scores are converted to ranks. This has been done in columns 3 and 4 of Table 4.3. Note that the student who was first on the aptitude test ranked third on the departmental examination, the student who was second on the aptitude test ranked fOUlth on the departmental examination, and so on. Comparing the ranks of the students on the two tests, as indicated in columns 3 and 4 of Table 4.3, gives us a fairly good pictlU"e of the relationship between the two sets of scores. From this inspection, we know that students who had a high standing o n the aptitude test also had a high standing on the departmental examination and that students who had a low standing on the aptitude test also had a low standing on the departmental examination. Our inspection of columns 3 and 4 also shows us, however, that the relationship between the students' ranks on the two tests is not perfect, as there is some shifting in rank from one test to another. Our problem now is how we can express the degree of relationship between these two sets of ranks in meaningful terms. This is where the scatter plot and the correlation coefficient become useful.

![](_page_98_Figure_4.jpeg)
in Figure 4.5. Each dot represents the two scores that were obtained by an individual student. The dots that correspond to the scores received by three of the students (Sandra, Carlos, and Jolm) are labeled (see Appendix A for another example and details on the construction of a scatter plot). The scatter plot immediately shows us two important facts about the relationship between scores on the aptitude test administered in the fall and student performance on the comprehensive departmental examination in the spring. First, students such as Sandra, who score well above average in the fall, usually do better than average on the comprehensive examination in the spring, whereas most students who score well below average in the fall also score below average in the spring (e.g. , Jolm). Second, there are some notable exceptions. Carlos, for example, ranked 15th out of 20 on the fall aptitude test, but he obtained the fifth-highest score on the comprehensive examination in the spring. Although both facts (that there is a relationship and that it is imperfect) also could be seen from studying the scores in Table 4.3, the scatter plot provides an efficient sUlrunary and makes it clear that some of the exceptions to the statement that there is a relationship between the two sets of scores are substantial.

The relationship seen in Figure 4.5 still has not been quantified. For thiS, we need to obtain a correlation coefficient-a statistical summary of the relationship between the scores on the two tests. The conÂ·elation coefficient we will use is known as the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and is denoted by r. Procedures for calculating this coefficient are desclibed in Appendix A. Here we will focus on its meaning.

When the procedures for calculating a product-moment correlation coefficient are applied to the scores for the 20 students in Mr. Tanaka's class, we find that *r* = 0.58. This

con'elation coefficient is a statistical summary of the degree of relationship between the two sets of scores in Mr. Tanaka's data. It indicates the extent to which the fall aptitude test scores (predictor) are predictive of the spring mathematics test scores (criterion). This type of correlation coefficient, called a validity coefficient, indicates the correlation between a test and a criterion measure. (A criterion-rela ted validation study should be based on a larger number of cases than the 20 students used here, but we are simply explaining what a validity coefficient is and how to interpret it.) The validity coefficient is not a measure of the validity of the test use or interpretation by itself because, as has already been emphasized, content, construct, and consequences are also important to the overall evaluative judgment of validity.

How good is Mr. Tanaka's validity coefficient of 0.58? Should Mr. Tanaka be happy or disappointed with this finding? Is this aptitude test a good predictor of future performance in mathematics? Unfortunately, there are no simple and straightforward answers to such questions.

The following correlation coeffidents indicate the extreme degree of relationship possible between variables:

1.00 = perfect positive relationship

0.00 = no relationship

- 1.00 = perfect negative relationship

Because Mr. Tanaka's validity coefficient is 0.58 , we know that the relationship is positive but substantially less than perfect. The closer a validity coeffident is to 1.00, the greater accuracy in predicting from one variable to another. A coefficient of -1.-- would also indicate perfect prediction from one variable to another, but in educational measurements we are most commonly concerned with positive relationships.

The three scatter plots in Figure 4.6 show in schematic form how Mr. Tanaka's validity coefficient of 0.58 compares with correlations of 0.00 and 1.00. Each dot on the scatter plot indicates an individual score's position on both the predictor and the criterion. Thus, with a correlation of 1.00, each individual falls at the same position on both measures, prOViding a perfect prediction. At the other eJ..'treme, with a correlation of 0.00, an individual's score on the predictor tells us nothing about the criterion score. At each score level on the predictor, some individuals have high criterion scores, some have low criterion scores, and others fall in between. There is simply no basis for predicting. The scatter plot for a correlation of about 0.60 indicates that high predictor scores tend to go with high criterion scores and that low predictor scores tend to go with low criterion scores, but the relationship is far from petfect. As the size of a correlation coefficient increases, the dots on a scatter plot move in the clirection of the diagonal series of dots shown for a petfect positive correlation (1.00), indicating increased prediction effiCiency.

Another way of evaluating Mr. Tanaka 's validity coefficient of 0.58 is to compare it with the validity coefficients obtained from other methods of predicting performance in mathematics. If this validity coefficient is larger than those obtained with other prediction procedures, Mr. Tanaka will continue to use the scholastic aptitude test as the best means available to him for predicting his students' mathematics performance. Thus, validity coefficients are large or small only in relation to one another. When prediction is important, we will always consider more favorably the test with the largest validity coefficient. In this regard, however, even aptitude tests with rather low validity may be useful if they are the best predictors available and if the predictions they provide are better than chance.

##### **Estimating Present Performance**

Up to this point, we have emphasized the role of the test-criterion relationship in predicting future pelformance. Although this is probably its major use, at times we are interested in the relation of test performance to some other current measure of performance. In this case, we obtain both measures at approximately the same time and correlate the results. This is commonly done when a test is being considered as a replacement for a more timeconsuming method of obtaining infonnation. For example, Mrs. Valencia, a biology teacher, wondered if an objective test of study skills could be used in place of the elaborate observation and rating procedures she was currently using. She believed tlut if a test could be substituted for tlle more complex procedures, she would have much more time to devote to individual students dtlling the supervised study period. An analysis of the specific student characteristics on which she rated the students' study skills indicated that many of the procedures could be stated in tlle form of objective test questions. Consequently, she developed an objective test of study skills that she administered to her students. To determine how adequately tlle test measured study skills, she cOlTelated the test results witll ratings of the students' study skills she obtained through arduous observation. The resulting correlation coefficient of 0.75 indicates considerable agreement between the test results and the criterion measure and validates Mrs. Valencia's test of study skills.

Several factors influence the size of correlation coefficients, including validity coefficients. Knowing these factors can help witll tlle interpretation of a palticular correlation coefficient-one we have computed ourselves or one found in a test manual. Basic factors to consider are shown in Figure 4.7. In general, larger correlation coefficients are

Basic factors influencing the size of correlation coefficients

obtained when the characteristics measured are more alike (e.g., correlating scores from two reading tests), the spread of scores is large, the stability of the scores is high, and the time span between measures is short. As we move along the continuum toward the other end of the scale on any of these factors, the correlation coefficients tend to become smaller. Thus, a small predictive validity coefficient might be explained, in part, by any one of the factors shown on the right side of Figure 4.7 or, more commonly, by some combination of them.

##### **Expectancy Table**

How well a test predicts future performance or estimates current perfomlance on some criterion measure also can be shown by directly plotting the data in a twofold chart as shown in Figure 4.8. Here, Mr. Tanaka's data (from Table 4.3) have been tabulated by placing a tally showing each individual's standing on both the fall aptitude scores and the spring mathematics scores. For example, Sandra scored 119 on the fall aptitude test and 77 on the spring math test, so a tally representing her perfoffilance was placed in the upper-right-hand cell. The performance of all other students on the two tests was tallied in the same manner. Thus, each tally mark in Figure 4.8 represents how well each of Mr. Tanaka's 20 students performed on the fall and spring tests. The total number of students in each cell and in each column and row is also indicated.

The expectancy grid shown in Figure 4.8 can be used as an expectancy table simply by using the frequendes in eadl cell. The interpretation of such information is simple and direct. For example, of those students who scored above average on the fall aptitude test, none scored, below 65 on the spring mathematics test, two of five scored between 65 and 74, and three of five scored between 75 and 84. Of those who scored below average on the fall aptitude test, none scored in the top categolY on the spring mathematics test, and four of five scored below 65. These interpretations are limited to the group tested, but from SUdl results one might make predictions concerning future students. We can say, for example, that students who score above average on the fall aptitude test will probably score above average on the spring mathematics test. Other predictiOns can be made in the same way by noting

**TABLE-Expectancy grid showing how scores on the fall aptitude test and spring mathematics test are tallied in appropriate cells (from data in Table 4.3)**

Figure 4.8


the frequendes in each cell of the grid in Figure 4.8. More commonly, the figures in an expectancy table are expressed in percentages, which can be readily obtained from the grid by converting each cell frequency to a percentage of the total number of tallies in its row. This has been done for the data in Figure 4.8, and the results are presented in Table 4.4. The first row of the table shows that of the five students who scored above average on the fall aptitude test, 40% (two students) scored between 65 and 74 on the spring math test, and (,0% thr~e snrrlents) sc.or~n hetween 7':.. ann M. The r~maininQ rows .~hol1ln he rearl in a .......... '------- ---\_ .. -----., - -----. - -- -- --, <sup>~</sup>-----. ..... .. ---- ----------Â·0 -- - ------- - - --\_ .. - --- . similar manner. The use of percentages makes the figures in each row and column comparable. Our predictions then can be made in standard terms (Le., dlances out of l()()) for all score levels. Our interpretation is apt to be a little more dear if we say that Maria's dunces of being in the top group on the criterion measure are 60 of l()() and that Jim's are only 10 of 100 than if we say that Maria's chances are 3 of 5 and Jim's are 1 of 10.

Expectancy tables take varied forms and may be used to show the relation between different types of measures. The number of categories used with the predictor or criterion, may be as few as two or as many as seem desirable. Also, the predictor may be

 Table 4.5


any set of measures useful in predicting, and the criterion may be course grades, ratings, test scores, or whatever measure of success is relevant. For example, expectancy tables are frequently used in predicting the grade-point averages of college freshmen by combining data from high school grades and an admissions test sud1 as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAD or the American College Testing Program's ACT. An example of such an expectancy table is shown in Table 45. When interpreting expectancy tables based on a small number of cases, such as Mr. Tanaka's dass of 20 stude nts, our predictions should be regarded as highly tentative. Each percentage is based on so few students that we can expect large fluctuations in these figures from one group of students to another. It is frequently possible to increase the number of students represented in the table by combining test results from several classes. When we do thiS, our percentages are, of course, much more stabie, and our predictions can be made with greater confidence. In any event, expectancy tables provide a simple and direct means of indicating the predictive value of test results.

Another commonly used approad1 to obtain predicted or estimated criterion petformance from scores on an assessment is by means of regression equations. The use of regression equations to obtain estimates will not be developed here, but it is illustrated in Appendix A.

##### **The "Criterion" Problem**

In a criterion-related validation study, a major problem is obtaining a satisfactory criterion of success. Remember that Mr. Tanaka used a comprehensive departmental examination as the o'iterion of success in his seventh-grade mathematics class and that Mrs. Valencia used her own ratings of the students' study skills. In each instance, the criterion of success was only partially suitable as a basis for test validation. Mr. Tanaka recognized that the departmental examination did not measure all the important learning outcomes that he aimed at in teaching mathematics. There was not nearly enough emphasis on problem solving or mathematical reasoning, the interpretation of graphs and charts was sadly neglected, and, of course, the test did not evaluate the students' attitudes toward mathematics (which Mr. Tanaka considered to be extremely important). Likewise, Mrs. Valencia was well aware of the shortcomings of her rating of students' study skills. She sensed that some students "put on a show" when they knew they were being observed and that other students were probably overrated on study skills because of their high achievement in class work. Despite these recognized shOItcomings, both Mr. Tanaka and Mrs. Valencia found it necessalY to use these criterion measures because they were the best available.

The plights of Mr. Tanaka and Mrs. Valencia in finding a suitable criterion of success for test valiclation are not unusual. For most educational purposes, there is no entirely satisfactory oÂ·iterion of success. Those used tend to be lacking in comprehensiveness and in most cases produce results that are less stable than those of the test being validated. The lack of a completely satisfactOlY criterion measure makes content and construct considerations all the more important.

#### **CONSIDERATION OF CONSEQUENCES**

Messick (1989, 1994) has argued persuasively that an overall judgment regarding the validity of particular uses and interpretations of assessment results requires an evaluation of the consequences of those uses and interpretations. Assessments are intended to contribute to improved student learning. The question is, Do they? And, if *so,* to what extent? What impact do assessments have on teaching? What are the possibly negative, unintended consequences of a palticular use of assessment results?

The expansion of the concept of validity to include consideration of the consequences of use and interpretation of assessment results has been especially impoltant in the recent movement [Oward more authentic, performance-based approaches to assessment. Several propoents of these alternative forms of assessment have argued that a heavy reliance on multiple-cl10ice tests, especially in situations where students and teachers are being held accountable for results, has had unintended negative effects. They argue that the high stakes associated with test results lead teacl1ers to focus narrowly on what is on the test while ignoring impoltant parts of the curriculum not covered by the test.

In some instances, a single form of a standardized test-that is, a single set of multiplechoice questions-is llsed year after year in a state or school district. **In** such a situation, the narrowing may be worse than simply focusing on the domain of skills that the test is intended to measure. It may lead to teaching the specific content of the test items. Not only would this be an undesirable narrowing of what is taught, but also it would likely inflate test scores and change the meaning of the results, possibly changing the construct measured from problem solving to memorization ability.

Although the negative effects are most serious where high stakes are attached to the results obtained on a single test form used year after year, the concern about consequences is not limited to such situations. Distoltions of instruction could be expected even if a new test form were used each year because of a lack of alignment of the test to the learning objectives emphasized in the curriculum. For example, a curriculum that emphasized problem solving and conceptual understanding could be undennined by holding teachers accountable for student scores on a test that emphasized low-level skills and factual knowledge. Drill and practice on the skills and facts emphasized on the test might raise scores but would not facilitate achievement of the primary learning goals.

Considerations of consequences are equally imp0Itant for performance-based assessment. It is just as impOltant to attend to both the intended positive effects and the possible unintended negative effects for performance-based assessments as it is for standardized, multiple-choice tests. For both types of assessment, consequences are directly related to tlle stakes mat are attached to the results. As the stakes increase for teachers or students, so too should tlle demands for evidence regarding consequences of the uses and interpretations of results.

An adequate consideration of consequences needs to include both intended consequences (e.g., contributes to learning, increases student motivation) and unintended consequences (e.g., narrows me cuniculum, increases the number of high school dropouts). Consequences are pa11icularly important where assessment results are used to make highstakes decisions regarding individuals (e.g., retention in grade, assignment to a remedial instructional program, or the award of a high school diploma).

The use of an assessment to retain students in grade is not recommended, but it is a way in which assessments are sometimes used and may be used to illustrate the impact of consequences on the overall validation. An analysis of consequences of the use of an assessment for retention in grade should seek evidence that students who are retained are generally better off man they would have been if they had not been retained. Such evidence might come from a comparison of me subsequent achievement and attitudes of students just below and just above the minimum score required for advancement in grade. A positive finding would require tllat students who were just below the cut score and therefore retained in grade eventually outperformed meir counterparts who were just above the cut score and therefore promoted in grade. The opposite finding would provide evidence that the use of assessment to retain students had negative consequences and would contribute to a judgment that grade retention was not a valid use of this asand eventual graduation rates. For a classroom assessment, studies of consequences obviously would be much less elaborate. Indeed, considerations of consequences generally would be limited to a logical analysis of likely effects.

Teachers have an excellent vantage point for considering the likely effects of assessments. First, they know the learning objectives that they are trying to help their students achieve. Second, they are quite familiar with instructional experiences that the students have had. Third, they have an 0Ppoltunity to observe students while they are working on an assessment task and to talk to students about their pelformances. This firsthand awareness of learning objectives, instnlctional experiences, and students can be brought to bear on an analysis of the likely effects of assessments by systematically considering questions such as the following:

1. Do tbe tasks matcll important learning objectives? WYI1WYG (What You Test Is What You Get) has become a popular slogan. Despite the fact that it is an oversimplification, it is a good reminder tlut assessments need to reflect major leaming outcomes. Problem-solVing skills and complex thinking skills requiring integration, evaluation, and syntllesis of information are more likely to be fostered by assessments that require the application of SUdl skills than by assessments that reqUire students merely to repeat what me teacher has said or what is stated in the textbook.

2. Is there reason to believe that students study harder in preparation for tbe assessment? Motivating student effort is a potentially important consequence of tests and assessments. The dunces of achieving this goal are improved if students have a dear understanding of what to expect on the assessment, know how the results will be used, and believe that the assessment will be fair.

3. Does tbe assessment artificially constrain tbe focus of students' Shldy? If it is judged important, for example, to be sure that students can solve a particular type of mathematics problem, then it is reasonable to focus an assessment on that type of problem. However, much will be missed if such an a pproach is the only mode of assessment. In many cases, the identification of the nature of the problem may be at least as important as facility with application of a particular formula or algorithm. Assessments that focus only on the latter skills are not likely to facilitate development of problem identification skills.

4. Does the assessment encourage or discourage exploration and creative modes of expression? Although it is important for students to know what to expect on an assessment and have a sense of what to do to prepare for it, care should be taken to avoid overly narrow and attificial constraints that will discourage students from exploring new ideas and concepts.

#### **FACTORS INFLUENCING VALIDITY**

Numerous factors tend to make assessment results invalid for their intended use. Some are rather obvious and easily avoided. No teacher would think of measuring knowledge of social studies with a mathematics assessment, nor would a teacher consider measuring problem-solving skills in third-grade mathematics with an assessment designed for seventh graders. In both instances, the assessment results would obviously be invalid. The factors influencing validity are of this same general nature but much more subtle in character. For example , a teacher may overload a social studies test with items concerning historical facts, and thus the scores are less valid as a measure of achievement in social studies. Or a third-grade tead1er may select appropriate mathematical problems for an assessment but use vocabulary in the problems and directions that only the better readers are able to understand. The mathematics assessment then becomes, in part, a reading assessment and reduces the validity of the results for their intended use. These examples show some of the more subtle factors influencing validity to whid1 the teacher should be alert, whether constructing dassroom assessments or selecting pUblished ones.

##### **Factors in the Test or Assessment Itself**

A careful examination of test items and assessment tasks will indicate whether the test or assessment appears to measure the subject matter content and the mental functions that the tea.cher is interested in assessing. However, any of the following factors can prevent the test items or assessment tasks from functioning as intended and thereby lower the validity of the interpretations from the assessment results. The first five factors are equally applicable for assessments with tasks requiring extended student performances and traditional tests. The last five factors apply most directly to tests with fixed-choice or sholt-answer items that are scored right or wrong.

**1.** Undear directions: Directions that do not dearly indicate to the student how to respond to the tasks and how to record the responses tend to reduce validity.

- 2. Reading vocabulary and sentence structure too difficult (construct-irrelevant variance): Vocabulary and sentence structure that are too complicated for the students taking the assessment result in the assessment's measuring reading comprehension and aspects of intelligence, which will distort the meaning of the assessment results.
- 3. Ambiguity: Ambiguous statements in assessment tasks contribute to misinterpretations and confusion. Ambiguity sometimes confuses the better students more than it does the poor students.
- 4. Inadequate time limits (construct-irrelevant variance): Time limits that do not provide students with enough time to consider the tasks and provide thoughtful responses can reduce the validity of interpretations of results. Rather than measuring what a student knows about a topic or is able to do given adequate time, the assessment may become a measure of the speed with whid1 the student can respond. For some content (e.g. , a typing test), speed may be important, but most assessments of achievement should minimize the effects of speed on student performance.
- 5. Overemphasis of easy-ta-assess aspects of domain at the expense of important but difficult-to-assess aspects (construct uuderrepresentation): It is easy to develop test questions that assess factual recall and generally harder to develop ones that tap conceptual understanding or higher-order thinking processes, such as the evaluation of competing positions or arguments. Hence, it is imp0Itant to guard against underrepresentation of tasks getting at the impOltant but more difficult-to-assess aspects of achievement.
- 6. Test items inappropriate for the outcomes being measured: Attempting to measure understanding, thinking skills and other complex types of acheivement with test forms that are appropriate only for measuring factual knowledge will invalidate the results.
- 7. Poorly constructed test items: Test items that unintentionally provide clues to the answer tend to measure the students' alertness in detecting clues as well as mastery of skills or knowledge the test is intended to measure.
- S. Test too short: A test is only a sample of the many questions that might be asked. If a test is too short to provide a representative sample of d1e performance we are interested in, then its validity will suffer accordingly.
- 9. Improper arrangement of items: Test items are typically arranged in order of difficulty, with the easiest items first. Pladng difficult items early in the test may cause students to spend too much time on these and prevent them from reaching items they could easily answer. Improper arrangement may also influence validity by having a detrimental effect on student motivation. This influence is likely to be strongest with young students.
- **10.** Identifiable pattern of answers: Placing conect answers in some systematic pattern (e.g., T, T, F, F or A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D) enables students to guess the answers to some items more easily, which lowers validity.

In sholt, any defect in the construction of the test or assessment that prevents it from functioning as intended will invalidate the interpretations to be drawn from the results. Much of what is written in the following chapters is directed toward helping teachers improve the validity of their interpretations of test scores and other assessment results.

##### Functioning of Tasks and Teaching Procedures

In assessing achievement, the ways in whidl tasks function cannot be determined merely by examining the form and content of the assessment. For example, the following task may appear to measure mathematical reasoning if examined without reference to what the students have been taught.

EXAMPLE Ken learned that 60% of the graduates from his high school are admitted to community colleges, 30% are admitted to public 4-year colleges or universities, and 10% are admitted to private 4-year colleges or universities. Since these percentages add up to 100, Ken reasons that he is sure to be admitted to some college or university. Explain, possibly with the use of a diagram, what is wrong with Ken's reasoning.

> However, if the teadler has taught the solution to this particular problem before giving the assessment, the task now will measure no more than memorized knowledge. Similarly, assessments of understanding critical thinking, and other complex learning outcomes will provide valid measures in these areas only if the tasks function as intended. If the students have previously been taught the solutions to the particular problems induded in the assessment or have been taught mechanical steps for obtaining the solutions, the assessment results cannot be considered valid indicators of the achievement of the more complex mental processes.

##### Factors in Administration and Scoring

The administration and scoring of an assessment may also introduce factors that have a detrimental effect on the validity of the interpretations from the results. In the case of teadler-made assessments, SUdl factors as insufficient time, unfair aid to individual students who ask for help, cheating, and unreliable scoring of student performances tend to lower validity. In the case of published tests, failure to follow the standard directions and time limits, giving students unauthorized assistance, and errors in scoring similarly contribute to lower validity. For all types of assessments, adverse physical and psychological conditions at the time of the assessment may also have a negative effect.

##### Factors in Student Responses

In some instances, invalid interpretations are caused by personal factors influencing a student's response to the assessment situation rather than to any shortcomings in the test instrument or its administration. Some students may be bothered by emotional disturbances that intelfere with their performance. Others may be frightened by the assessment situation and so are unable to respond nOimally, and still others may not be motivated to put forth their best effort. These and other factors that restrict and modify students' responses in the assessment situation obviously distort the results.

##### **Nature of the Group and the Criterion**

Validity is always specific to a particular group. A mathematics test based on story problems, for example, may measure reasoning ability in a group at an early stage of instruction and a combination of simple recall of information and computation skill in a more advanced group. Similarly, scores on a science assessment may be accounted for largely by reading comprehension in one group and by knowledge of facts in another. What an assessment measures may be influenced by such factors as age, gender, ability level, educational background, and cultural background. Thus, in appraising reports of validity included in test manuals or other sources, it is inlpoltant to determine the nature of the validation group. How closely it compares in significant characteristics with the group of students we wish to assess determines how applicable the information is to our particular group.

As shown in Figure 4.7, correlations between a test and a criterion will be smaller when (a) the characteristics measured by the test and the o'iterion are less alike, (b) the spread of scores is smaller, (c) the stability of scores is lower, and (d) the time span between measures is longer. Of these factors, probably the most frequently overlooked is the nature of the criterion being predicted. This is unfortunate because knowing the specific nature of the criterion can help evaluate assessment-criterion correlations. For example, scores on a mamematics aptitude test are likely to provide a more accurate prediction of achievement in a science course in whicll quantitative problems are stressed than in one in which they play only a minor role. Ukewise, we can expect scores on a critical-tllinking test to correlate more highly with grades in social studies courses mat emphasize critical thinking tllan in those that depend largely on the memorization of the factual infonnation. These examples simply illustrate me general mle mat assessmentcriterion cOll'elations are influenced by the simila1ity between the perfonnance measured by tlle test and tlle pelfotn1ance represented in the oÂ·iterion. Thus, botll need to be examined carefully for a full understanding of the relationship.

Because validity infonnation varies with the group tested and me composition of the criterion measures used, published validation data should be considered highly tentative. When possible, the validity of me test results should be checked in the specific local situation.

##### **Teaching and Evaluating Assessments**

As discussed earlier in this chapter, validity is the most important consideration in testing. Ultimately, me responsibility for interpreting and using test scores belongs to me user, who is frequently me teacher in the classroom. Altll0ugh mis chapter has given a broad range of validation strategies for teachers to use in evaluating tests, not all strategies will be used evelY time. The validation strategy that might be used in any given context will valy. Different strategies will be used wim different types of tests (e.g., classroom tests vs. mandated tests, achievement vs. attitude) or different formats (e.g., open ended vs. mUltiple choice). In fact, the validation strategies may valY for each different use or interpretation of the same test. For example, a state-mandated assessment would require different validation strategies to show how well the content standards are being taught as opposed to making a decision about retaining students on a given grade level. Thus, teachers are left in a quandary about what to use from mis chapter.

Although there is not a simple and straightforward choice on which validation strategies to use, experience with assessments will guide the questions to ask and the types of information to collect. Neveltheless, some minimal guidelines for evaluating assessments may be appropriate, and questions that should be asked for achievement tests are presented. Each of these gUiding questions is intended to be used with any achievement test, but the method of accumulating validity evidence may vary for mandated standardized tests and classroom tests. The evidence collected might also be more systematic with some types of classroom assessments. For example, the evidence would not be as detailed for a weekly quiz as it would be for an end-of-the-semester final.

1. Does the content represent the construct? Remember, *what* you *test* is *what* you *get.* The degree to which the content represents the construct should always be closely examined. In the case of state- or district-mandated assessments, studies should be completed and made available to teacllers so that they understand the interpretations that can be made from student test scores. Teachers should request this infonnation and examine the content standards, instluctional objectives, or blueprints on which the test content is based. Even with weekly quizzes, teachers should pay close attention to the content. In the absence of forulal data collection, teachers should be prepared to describe the content of their tests and be able to interpret test scores without generalizing beyond what is measured. Teachers may also be more systematic in their evaluation of the test content with tests that have greater impact than weekly quizzes. End-of-the-semester finals should be systematically examined on the basis of blueprints to make sure that they adequately sample the domain. In summary, teachers can examine content by understanding evidence collected by otherS (e.g., i1hifldated standardi.zed tests), by Creati.flg their OWfl systefIlatic evidence using blueprints (e.g. , finals), or by a more informal examination of the assessment (e.g., weekly quizzes).

2. Will the test items elicit responses from the student that are consistent with the COIlstmct? For mandated standardized tests and classroom assessments, understanding the student response processes is crucial to understanding the interpretations that can be made from test scores. Tests of reasoning or higher-order thinking should avoid using items that elicit rote responses. Even complex items, when practiced, can be answered on the basis of memory rather than problem-solving skills. On the other hand, basic measures of factual information should not include items that elicit complex responses. Teachers should examine the types of items used and understand student responses and how these responses are related to the interpretation and use of tests scores. If you are unclear about how to interpret student responses, interview the students shortly after test admin**i.stratiarl.** 

3. What are the consequences of using the assessment? Any achievement test should be examined for the consequences on student motivation and learning. Even with classroom assessments, teachers should monitor the effect of the assessment on student learning and motivation. A test that leads to a nanÂ·ow interpretation of the construct by measuring the content too narrowly or with limited response formats or that reduces student motivation to try to do well on the assessment is counterproductive to teaching, learning, and assessment. When these types of effects are observed, they should be taken into account in the interpretation of test scores. As much as possible, teachers should By to reduce these effects by strategies such as valying the formats of the assessment and creating assessments that engage students.

4. What is the relationship between the test scores and the clitelion? For state- and district-mandated standardized assessments, this type of evidence should be made available to teachers. The evidence would be reported in a number of ways as outlined in this chapter. With classroom assessments, teacl1ers should plan studies to examine the relationship of some criterion with the achievement test. For finals or other important tests, teachers should look at the relationship of the assessment with criteria such as grades or their ratings of the students. To keep computations simple, teachers could routinely divide both tl1e assessment and the criterion into a few groups (e.g., top, middle, and bottom third) and use simple approacl1es, such as an expectancy table. Expectancy tables will inform teachers about whether a test is consistent with their expectations or grades in the content area and thus lead to a better understanding of the interpretation of test scores. Even with weekly quizzes, teachers should informally examine who received high grades and who did not receive high grades. This logical analysis gives further evidence about how to interpret test scores.

In sum, teachers will have a vast array of options for examining the validity of the assessments that tl1ey use. When using required assessments from the district or state, the validation has often been completed, and the teacher's task is to examine the data to guide the appropriate uses and interpretations that can be made from the assessment. In contrast, teacher-made assessments will not automatically have data available to examine. Instead, teachers need to plan the validation studies witl1in the limited time and resources available to to them in their classrooms. As a result the primary resource available for examining  assessments are the teacl1ers and their colleagues. Thus, the validation of an assessment in the classroom will rely heavily on teacl1er judgments with the cooperation of fellow teacl1 ers. The box "Checklist for Validation of Classroom As5essment" provides an example of the types of data that teachers might reasonably collect to examine the validity of an assessment for a particular lise or interpretation. The checklist would provide a record of (a) reviews of the test by other teachers, (b) observations or interviews of smdents taking the test, and (c) potential consequences of tl1e test.

#### **SUMMARY**

The most important quality to consider when constructing or selecting an assessment procedure is validity, which refers to the meaningfulness and appropriateness of the lIses and interpretations to be made of assessment results. When assessing validity, keep in mind that validity is a quality of the interpretation of the results rather than of the assessment itself, tl1at its presence is a matter of degree, tl1at it is always specific to some palticular interpretation or use, and that it is a unitary concept.

Although validity is a unitary concept it involves the consideration of several kinds of evidence. Considerations of content, constmct, assessment-criterion relationships, and consequences all can contribute to the meaning of a set of results; validity is strongest when evidence to SUppOIt all four of these considerations is present.

An analysis of the content of an assessment should evaluate the appropriateness of the content domain and determine the extent to which the assessment tasks provide a relevant and representative sample of the domain of content under consideration. Content considerations are especially impottant when validating acllievement testing or constructing classroom tests and assessments. Written specifications for the assessment should define a domain of instructionally relevant tasks, and then tasks that provide a representative sample of the domain should be constructed or selected. Content considerations are also important when selecting published achievement tests. Here the crucial question is how well the test measures the content and objectives of the local instructional program. The same types of test specifications used in constructing classroom tests can aid in selecting published tests.

Construct validation is the process of determining the extent to which performance on an assessment can be interpreted in terms of one or more construct. Construct validation typically includes consideration of content and may include assessment-criterion relationships as well as several other types of information. Critical concerns in construct validation include both the possibility that important aspects of the intended construct to be measured are left out or inadequately represented (Le., construct underrepresentation) and the possibility that pelformance is influenced by factors that are irrelevant or ancillary to the intended consmlct (construct-inelevant variance). The influence of construct-irrelevant factors on pelformance is of palticular concern when it affects the fairness of interpretations or use of assessment results. The procedure is one of clarifying what is being measured and what factors influence the assessment results so that performance can be interpreted most meaningfully. This involves both logical analysis and various comparative and correlational studie. Although the accumulation of evidence could be endless, in practical  situations we need to focus on the types of evidence that are reasonable to obtain and that are most relevant to the types of interpretations to be made. The more complete the evidence is, the more confident we can be concerning the meaning of the assessment results.

Studies of the extent to which test performance is related to some other valued measure of performance (called a criterion) also contribute to the overall evaluation of the validity of an assessment, especially when the assessment is used as an indicator of likely performance in other settings (e.g., achieving good grades in college). This may involve studies of how well test scores predict future performance (predictive validation. study) or estimate some current performance (concurrent validation study). These validity studies are typically reported by means of a correlation coefficient called a validity coefficient, by use of an expectancy table, or by solving a regression equation that converts test scores to estimated performance on the criterion. Assessment-criterion relationships are pertinent whenever test results are used to make predictions or substitute for assessment results obtained by more time-consuming methods, but they are of special significance in aptitude testing. Because the meaning of test scores is enhanced by knowing what other measures they relate to, assessment-criterion relationships are also used in construct validation.

Finally, the consequences of a particular use or interpretation of assessment results are important in arriving at an overall evaluative judgment of the validity of the assessment for that use or interpretation. The evaluation of consequences needs to attend to the anticipated positive effects of a particular use (e.g., enhancing student motivation). It is at least as important, however, to investigate plausible unintended consequences (e.g., increased anxiety, narrowing of instruction). The need of evidence regarding consequences increases as the stakes attached to the assessment results increase.

Many other factors tend to influence the validity of interpretations of tests and assessments. Some of these influences can be found in the test or assessment itself, some in the relationship of teaching to testing and assessment, some in the administration and scoring of the measure, some in the atypical responses of students to the assessment situation, and still others in the nature of the group assessed and in the composition of the criterion measures used. A major aim in the construction, selection, and use of tests and other assessment procedures is to control those factors that have an adverse effect on validity and to interpret the results in accordance with what validity information is available.

This discussion of factors influencing the validity of test and assessment results has shown how pervasive the concept of validity is. Ultimately, it is the users of tests and assessments who must make the final judgment concerning the validity of the uses and interpretations. Teachers need to become actively involved in examining and creating validity evidence to interpret and use tests in the teaching, learning, and assessment process.

### CHAPTER 5:  **RELIABILITY AND OTHER DESIRED CHARACTE RISTI CS**

N ext to validity, reliability is the most important charactelistic of assessment results. Reliability (a) provides the consistency that makes validity possible and (b) indicates the degree to which various kinds of generalizations are justifiable. The practicality of the evaluation procedure is, of course, also of concern to the busy classroom teacher. **In** Chapter '-I we emphasized that validity is the most unpo11ant consideration in the selection and construction of assessment procedures. Fair use and interpretation of assessment results depends on validity. Thus. fU'st and foremost, we want assessment results to serve the specific uses for which they are intended. Next in importance is reliability, and following that is a host of practical features [hat can be best classified under the heading "usability."

#### **NATURE OF RELIABILITY**

Reliability refers to the consistency of measurement, that is, how consistent test scores or other assessment results are from one measurement to another. Suppose, for instance, that Ms. Johnson has just given an achievement assessment to her students. How similar would the SUI dents' scores have been had she assessed them yesterday, or tomolTow, or next week? How would the scores have varied had she selected a different sample of tasks? How much would the scores have differed had a different teacher scored it? These are the types of questions with which reliability is concerned. Assessment results merely provide a limited measure of performance obtained at a particular tune. Unless the measurement can be shown to be reasonably consistent (Le., generalizable) over different occasions, different raters, or different samples of the same performance domain, we can have little confidence in the results.

We cannot expect assessment results to be perfectly consistent. Numerous factors other than the quality being measured may influence assessment results. If a single

107

assessment is administered to the same group twice in close succession, some variation in scores can be expected because of temporaty fluctuations in memo!)" attention, effort, fatigue, emotional strain, guessing, and the like. With a longer time between tests, additional variation in scores may be caused by intervening learning experiences, changes in health, forgetting, and less comparable assessment conditions. If essays or other types of student performances are evaluated by different raters, some variation in scores can be expected because of less-than-perfect agreement among raters. If we use a different sample of tasks in the second assessment, still another factor is likely to influence the results. Individuals may find one assessment easier than the other because it happens to contain more tasks on topics with which they are familiar. Such extraneous factors as these introduce a certain amount of measurement error into all assessment results. Methods of determining reliability are essentially means of determining how mucl1 measurement error is present under different conditions. In general, the more consistent our assessment results are from one measurement to another, the less elTor there will be and, consequently, the greater the reliability.

The meaning of reliability, as applied to testing and assessment, can be fLnther clarified by noting the following general points.

**1.** Reliability refers to the results obtained with an assessment instrument and not to the instnunent itself: Any particular instmment may have a number of different reliabilities, depending on the group involved and the situation in whicl1 it is used. Thus, it is more appropriate to speak of the reliability of the test scores or of the assessment results than of the test or the assessment.

2. An estimate of reiiabiiity aiways refers to a particuiar type of consistency: Assessment results are not reliable in general. They are reliable (or generalizable) over different periods of time, over different samples of tasks, over different raters, and the like. It is possible for assessment results to be consistent in one of these respects and not in another. The appropriate type of consistency in a particular case is dictated by the use to be made of the results. For example, if we wish to know what individuals will be like at some future time, constancy of scores over time will be important. On the other hand, if we want to measure an individual's cunent understanding of certain scientific principles, we are apt to be more interested in the consistency of performance across different tasks designed to allow students to apply those principles. Thus, for different interpretations, we need different analyses of consistency. Treating reliability as a general characteristic can lead to enoneous interpretations.

3. Reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity: An assessment that produces totally inconsistent results cannot possibly provide valid information about the performance being measured. On the other hand, highly consistent assessment results may be measuring the wrong thing or may be used in inappropriate ways. Thus, low reliability indicates that a low degree of validity is present, but high reliability does not ensure a high degree of validity. In short, reliability merely provides the consistency that makes validity possible.

4. Reliability is assessed primarily with statistical indices: The logical analysis of an assessment will provide little evidence concerning the reliability of the scores. To evaluate the consistency of scores assigned by different raters, two or more raters must score the same set of student performances. Similarly, an evaluation of the consistency of scores obtained in response to different forms of a test or different collections of perfonuancebased assessment tasks requires the administration of both test forms or collections of tasks to an appropriate group of students. Whether the focus is on interrater consistency or the consistency aoÂ·oss forms or collections of tasks, consistency may be expressed in tenus of shifts in the relative standing of persons in the group or in tenus of the amount of variation to be expected in an individual's score. Consistency in the first case is reported by means of a correlation coefficient called a reliability coefficient (see the "Tenninology" box) and in the second case is reported by means of the standard error of measurement. Both methods of expressing reliability are widely used and should be understood by persons responsible for interpreting assessment results.

#### **DETERMINING RELIABILITY BY CORRELATION METHODS**

In detennining reliability, it would be desirable to obtain two sets of measures under identical conditions and then compare the results. This procedure is impossible, of course because the conditions under which assessment data are obtained can never be identical. As a substitute for this ideal procedure, several methods of estimating reliability have been introduced (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999). The methods are similar in assessment procedure or from equivalent forms of the same procedure. The correlation coefficient used to determine reliability is calculated and interpreted in the same manner as that used in detennining statistical estimates of validity. The only difference between a validity coefficient and a reliability coefficient is that the former is based on agreement with an outside oiterion and the latter on agreement between two sets of results from the same procedure.

![](_page_118_Picture_5.jpeg)

Correlation coefficient: A statistic that indicates the degree of relationship between any two sets of scores obtained from the same group of individuals (e.g., correlation between height and weight). Validity coefficient: A correlation coefficient that indicates the degree to which a measure predicts or estimates performance on some criterion measure (e.g.,

correlation between scholastic aptitude scores and grades in Sd1001).

Reliability coefficient: A correlation coefficient that indicates the degree of relationship between two sets of scores intended to be measures of the same characteristic (e.g. , correlation between scores assigned by two different raters or scores obtained from administrations of two forms of a test).

The chief methods of estimating reliability are shown in Table 5.1. Note that different types of consistency are determined by the different methods: consistency over a period of time , over different forms of the assessment, within the assessment itself, and over different raters. The reliability coeffident resulting from each method must be interpreted according to the type of consistency being investigated. Each of these methods of estimating reliability is considered in fulther detail as we proceed .

##### **Test- Retest Method**

To estimate reliability by means of the testdetest method , the same assessment is administered twice to the same group of students with a given time interval between the two administrations (see Figure 5.1). The resulting assessment scores are correlated, and this correlation coeffident provides a measure of stability; that is, it indicates how stable the assessment results are over the given period of time. If the results are highly stable, then those students who are high on one administration of the assessment will tend to be high on the other administration, and the remaining students will tend to stay in the ir same relative positions on both administrations. Such stability is indicated by a large correlation coefficient. Recall from our previous discussion of correlation coefficients that a perfect positive relationship is indicated by 1.00 and no relationship by 0.00. Measures of stability in the 0.80 range are commonly reported for standardized tests of aptitude and achievement over occasions within the same year.

One important factor to keep in mind when interpreting measures of stability is the time inte rval between assessments. If the time interval is shott , say, a day or two, the

constancy of the results will be inflated because students will remember the tasks and their responses to them from the first assessment. If the time interval is long, say, about a year, the results will be influenced not only by the instability of the assessment procedure but also by actual changes in the students over that period of time. In general, the longer the interval between the first and second assessments, the more the results will be influenced by changes in the student characteristic being measured and the smaller the reliability coefficient will be.

The best time interval between assessment administrations will depend largely on the use to be made of the results. Because college admissions test scores may be submitted as part of an application to college several years after the test was taken, stability over several years is quite important. But stability over a long period is neither important nor desirable for an assessment of performance on a unit in a course that is focused on student understanding of certain concepts and readiness to move on to new material. Thus, for some decisions we are interested in reliability coefficients based on a long interval between test and retest; for others, reliability coefficients based on a short interval may be sufficient. The important thing is to seek evidence of stability that fits the particular interpretation to be made.

The test-retest method is unlikely to be relevant for teacher-constructed classroom tests because it is seldom possible or desirable to readminister the same assessment. In choosing standardized tests, however, stability is an important criterion. The test manual should provide evidence of stability, indicating the interval between tests and any unusual experiences the group members might have had between test administrations. Other things (such as validity) being equal, a test shown to possess the type of stability needed to make sound decisions is the best test.

Stability is also an important consideration when using assessment results from school records. When using any assessment result from permanent records, check the date of the assessment and any stability data available to determine whether the results are still dependable. If there is doubt and the decision is important, a reassessment is in order.

Test-retest method (using same test forms)

##### **Equivalent-Forms Method**

The equivalent-forms method for estimating reliability uses two different but equivalent forms of an assessment (also called parallel or alternate forms). Equivalent forms are built to the same set of specifications (e.g., test content and difficulty) but are constmcted independently. The two forms of the assessment are administered to the same group of students in close succession, and the resulting assessment scores are correlated. This correlation coefficient provides a measure of tlle degree to which generalizations about student perfonnance from one assessment to another are justified. Thus, it indicates the degree to whicll the two assessments are measuring tlle same aspects of behavior.

The equivalent-forms method tells us nothing about the long-term stability of the student characteristic being measured. Rather, it reflects short-tenn constancy of student performance and the extent to which the assessment represents an adequate sample of the characteristic being measured. **In** assessing achievement, for example, thousands of tasks might be presented in a particular assessment, but because of time limits and other restricting factors, only some of the possible tasks can be used. The tasks included in the assessment should provide an adequate sample of the possible tasks in tlle area. The easiest way to estimate whether an assessment measures an adequate sample of tlle content is to constlUct versions of tlle assessment that are intended to cover the same domain of content and student skills and correlate the results. A high conÂ·ela tion indicates that the two assessments are providing similar results and, therefore, are probably reliable samples of tlle general area of content being measured. Of course, both forms have to follow rigorous content sampling procedures as outlined in the test blueprint (see Chapter 4) since the correlation only represents equivalence without regard to the general content area.

The equivalent-forms method of estimating reliability is widely used in standardized testing because most standardized tests have two or more fonTIS available. In fact, a teacher should be suspicious of any standardized test tllat has two fonTIS available and does not provide information about equivalence. The comparability of tlle results of tlle two forms cannot be assumed unless such evidence is presented. The equivalent-forms method is sometimes used with an interval between the administration of the two forms of tlle test (see Figure 5.2). Under tllese test-retest conditions, tlle resulting reliability coefficient provides a measure of stability and equivalence. This is a more rigorous test of reliability than the test-retest method or equivalent-forms method willi a short interval between forms, because the stability of the testing procedures, the constancy of the student characteristic being measured, and the representativeness of the sample of tasks included in the test all are taken into account. Consequently, this is generally recommended as the soundest procedure for estimating the reliability of test scores. As with the ordinary test- retest method, the reliability coefficieflt must be ifltetpfeted i.n light of the i.fIteival between the two fOiTIls of the test. For longer time periods, expect smaller reliability coefficients.

##### **Split-Half Method**

Reliability can also be estimated from a single administration of a single form of an assessment. The assessment. is administered to a group of students in the usual manner and then is divided in half for scoring purposes. The split-half method is easy to implement with a traditional t.est or quiz consisting of, say, 10 or more items. To split the test into

Equivalent-forms method (without and with a time interval)

halves that are equivalent, the usual procedure is to score the even-numbered and the odd-numbered tasks separately (see Figure 5.3). This produces two scores for each student that, when correlated, provide a measure of internal consistency. This coefficient indicates the degree to which consistent results are obtained from the two halves of the test and may be thought of as the "half-length test reliability estimate. "

Although most often applied with traditional tests containing a sizable number of items, the split-half method is also applicable to assessments that consist of a smaller number of tasks each or that require a more extended period of time to complete. Some limited information can be obtained with as few as two tasks by correlating the scores obtained on one task with those obtained on another. Better information is provided as the number of tasks increases. With a small number of tasks, say, fOllr to eight, it is better to divide the tasks into two sets that are judged to be most comparable to each other than to rely on the more mechanical odd-even method that is appropriate where a larger number of tasks or items is available.

Odd-even scoring for use of split-half method (odd and even scores are then correlated)

As previously noted, the reliability coefficient is determined by correlating the scores of two half assessments. To estimate the scores' reliability based on the full-length assessment, the Spearman-Brown formula is usually applied.

Realiability on full assessment = = 2 times correlation between half assessments

The simplicity of the formula can be seen in the following example, in which the correlation coefficient between scores on the assessment's two halves is 0.60.

Reliability on full assessment = (2)(0.60) = 1.20 = 0.75

This correlation coefficient of 0.75, then, estimates the reliability of a full assessment when the half assessments correlated at 0.60. The split-half method is similar to the equivalent-forms method in that it indicates the extent to which the sample of tasks is a dependable sample of the content being measured. A high correlation between scores on the two halves of an assessment denotes the equivalence of the two halves and consequently the adequacy of the sampling. Split-half reliabilities tend to be higher than equivalent-forms reliabilities because the split-half method is based on the administration of a single assessment. When two forms of an assessment are administered, even in close succession, more opportunity for inconsistency is introduced (e.g., differences from form to form in attention, speed of work, effort, fatigue, and assessment content). Because the equivalent-forms method takes into account more sources of inconsistency, it provides a more stringent evaluation of reliability.

##### Coefficient Alpha


Another method of estimating the reliability of assessment scores from a single administration is by means of formulas such as those developed by Kuder and Richardson and the generalized formula for coefficient alpha. As with the split-half method, these formulas provide an index of internal consistency but do not require splitting the assessment in half for scoring purposes. An early special case of coefficient alpha was called Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20), and is applicable only in situations where student responses are scored dichotomously (zero or one) and therefore is most useful with traditional test items that are scored as right or wrong. The KR-20 is based on the proportion of persons passing each item and the standard deviation of the total scores. (A standard deviation is a measure of the spread of scores; see Appendix A.) The generalization of the KR-20 for assessments that have more than dichotomous, right-wrong scores (e.g., each task is scored on a 5-point scale), is called coefficient alpha. The computation of either KR-20 or coefficient alpha is rather cumbersome unless information is already available concerning the proportion passing or the standard deviations of scores for individual tasks; however, with the increasing availability of microcomputers and software for scoring and analyzing tests, it is now more feasible to obtain coefficient alpha estimates of reliability.

Here, our concern is with the interpretation of the coefficients rather than the calculations. Coefficient alpha estimates of reliability provide information about the degree to which the items or tasks in the assessment measure similar cllaracteristics. For a test with relatively homogeneous content (e.g., a mathematics computation test), the reliability estimate generally will be similar to that provided by the split-half method. Indeed, coefficient alpha can be thought of as the average of all possible split-half coefficients for the groups tested. This is an advantage when considering an assessment with relatively homogeneous content, because the estimate does not depend on the way in whicll the items are assigned to the two half tests as in the split-half method. However, for assessments designed to measure more heterogeneous learning outcomes (e.g., an assessment covering ancient history, the Middle Ages, and modem history), coefficient alpha will usually be smaller than that provided by the split-half method, and the latter method is to be preferred.

The simplicity of applying the split-half method or the coefficient alpha method (Le. , only a single test administration) has led to their widespread use in determining reliability. Certain limitations, however, restrict their value. First, they are not appropriate for speeded assessments--for assessments with time limits that prevent students from attempting every task. If speed is a significant factor in the assessment, reliability estinlates will be inflated to an unknown degree. This poses no great problem in estimating the reliability of results from teacher-made assessments because these are usually designed to allow students adequate time to complete all the tasks. **In** the case of standardized tests, however, time limits are seldom so liberal that all students complete the test. Thus, measures of internal consistency reported in test manuals should be interpreted with caution unless evidence is also presented that speed of work is a negligible factor. For speeded tests, reliability obtained by the test-retest or equivalent-fonus method should be sought.
A second limitation of internal consistency procedures is that they do not indicate the constancy of student responses from day to day. **In** tills regard, they are sin1llar to the equivalent-forms method without a time interval. Only test- retest procedures indicate the extent to which test results are generalizable over different periods of time.

##### **Interrater Consistency**

Judgment is required in scoring student responses to many types of assessments. This is obvious in the case of essay exams, but judgment is also required in scoring responses to open-ended mathematics problems or laboratory exercises in science. When student work is judgmentally scored, it is reasonable to ask whether the same scores would be assigned by another equally qualified judge. Individual classroom teachers seldom have the luxury of having another teacller to independently score examples of student work from their classroom, but there is a growing need to evaluate interrater consistency as a result of the increasing numbers of state- and district-mandated assessments that must be judgmentally scored.

Estimation of interrater consistency is relatively straightforward. Two or more raters must independently score the performances obtained for an appropriately selected sample of students. Consistency can be evaluated by correlating the scores assigned by one judge with those assigned by another judge. Consistency can also be evaluated by computing the propOltion of times that students' performances receive exactly the same scores from a pair of raters and the proportion that are within a single point of each other.

Suppose, for example, that two raters independently scored 50 student essays on a 6-point scale. The results of tile ratings are surrunarized in Table 5.2. Rater 1 assigned a score of 6 to five of the essays. For those five essays, Rarer 2 assigned a score of 6 to three of them and scores of 4 and 5 to ilie other two. Thus, each entty in a cell of Table 5.2 shows the number of essays that Rater 1 assigned ilie score associated witll the row, while Rater 2 assigned ilie score associated witll the column of the table.

The percentage of exact agreement is obtained by summing the counts where both raters assigned the same score (shown in boldface type), dividing that sum by tile total number of essays, and multiplying ilie result by 100, as follows:

Percentage exact agreement = 100 â¢ [(3 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 3)/ 50] = 48%

The percentage of times iliat raters agreed to within 1 point (all tile counts between the two diagonal lines) would be computed in a similar fashion. For this example, the percentage of agreement witlun 1 score point is 88% (100 x [44150]). One other indicator is tile correlation between the two sets of scores, Which, for the data in Table 5.2, is 0.80. The level of interrater consistency shown in Table 5.2 is high in comparison to levels of consistency generally achieved by independent raters. Even so, 6 of the 50 students would have their scores fluctuate by 2 points, depending on the person doing tile scoring. One way to reduce the influence of raters is to have each performance independently scored by two or more raters and lise the average rating. Double scoring is a common practice in situations where judgmentally scored performances have important consequences for individuals.

The percentage of agreement and correlation values indicates the degree to which however, to have a lugh correlation and even a high percentage of agreement while still having important differences in the overall leniency of the two raters. Where there

are disagreements, there is a strong tendency for one rater to consistently give a higher score than the other. Compal'isons of the average score assigned by each rater provide a check on differences in leniency. For the example in Table 5.2, the average ratings assigned to the essays are reasonably similar (3.52 for Rater 1 and 3.60 for Rater 2). Thus, there is no cause for concern in this case. On the other hand, the results shown in Table 5.3 (which might have been obtained if Rater 1 had been paired with Rater 3 instead of Rater 2) clearly indicate that Rater 3 is much more lenient than Rater 1 despite the fact that the percentage of exact agreement and the percentage of agreement within 1 point are the same (48% and 88%, respectively) for the data in Table 5.3 as they are for the data in Table 5.2.

The evaluation of interrater consistency is important to ensure that some students do not receive high scores as the result of rater leniency while others receive low scores because their work was scored by a stringent rater. Average scores assigned by raters to a common set of responses, percentage of agreement, and the correlation between scores assigned by rater pairs contribute to an overall evaluation of the degree of consistency among different raters.

Achieving a high degree of interrater consistency requires the development of consensus among raters regarding the types of perfonnances that are valued. Agreed-on scoring rubrics and training of raters to use those rubrics with examples of student work are generally required to achieve acceptable levels of interrater consistency and ensure that differences in the stringency of rating from one rater to another do not place some students at a disadvantage.

Adlieving interrater consistency is important for judgmentally scored tasks, but it says nothing about other types of consistnecy for example a high degree of interrater consistency does not guarantee consistency of ratings across tasks. There are other methods of evaluating various types of consistency or generalizability (e.g., across raters, across

tasks, and over time) simultaneously. Generalizability theory provides the foundation for Cour those methods. That theory is beyond the scope of this book, but a good introduction is provided by Shavelson and Webb (1991).

##### Comparing Methods

As stated earlier, each of the methods of estimating reliability provides different information concerning the consistency of test results. A summary of this information is presented in Table 5,4, which shows that most methods are concerned with only one or two types of consistency. As its name suggests, the interrater method evaluates only the degree of consistency of scores assigned to the same performances by different raters. The test-retest method, without a time interval, takes into account only the consistency of the assessment procedure and the short-term constancy of the response. If a time interval is introduced between the assessments, the constancy of the characteristics of the student from day to day also will be included. However, neither of the test-retest procedures provides information concerning the consistency of results over different samples of tasks because both sets of scores are based on the same assessment.

The equivalent-forms method without a time interval, the split-half method, and the coefficient alpha method all take into account the consistency of assessment procedures and the consistency of results over different samples of tasks. Only the equivalent-forms method with an intervening time period between tests takes into account all three types of consistency, which is the reason that this measure of stability and equivalence is generally regarded as the most useful estimate of reliability.

#### **STANDARD ERROR OF MEASUREMENT**

If it were possible to assess a student over and over on the same assessment procedures, we would find that the scores would valY somewhat. The amount of variation in the scores would be directly related to the reliability of tile assessment procedures. Low reliability would be indicated by large variations in the student's assessment results, and high reliability would be indicated by little variation from one assessment to another. Although it is impractical to administer the same set of assessment tasks many times to the same students, it is possible to estimate the amount of variation to be expected in tile scores. This estimate is called the standard error of measurement.

Test manuals for published tests usually list the standard enors of measurement. Thus, all we need to do is take tile standard error into account when interpreting individual test scores. For example, let us assume that we have just administered a standardized achievement test battery to a dass of fourth-grade students and the results indicate that MalY Shea has a grade-equivalent (GE) score of 5.2 on the mathematics test. A GE score indicates tile grade level that the average student has who has the same number of correct answers as Mary. (See Chapter 16 for a discussion of GE scores.) We find in the test manual that the standard error of measurement on tile mathematics test is 0.4. What does ti1e 0.4 tell us about Maly's mathematics achievement? In general, it indicates the amount of error tllat must be considered in interpreting Mary's score. More specifically, it provides the limits within which we can reasonably expect to fmd Mary's tlue mathematics adlievement score. A true score is one that would be obtained if ti1e test were perfectly reliable. If Mary Shea were tested repeatedly under identical conditions and there were no memory, leal'ning, practice, or fatigue effects, 680/0 of her obtained scores would fali within one standard error (0.4) of her true score, 95% wouid fall within two standard errors (0.8), and 99.7% would fall within three standard errors 0.2) (see the box "Hypothetical Distribution Illustrating the Standard Enor of Measurement").

For practical purposes, these limits may be applied to Mary's obtained score of 5.2 to give us the ranges shown in Table 5.5, within which we could be reasonably sure to find her true score.

Although Mary's score of 5.2 indicates that she did better on this particular test than the typical fOlllth-grade student, the range of scores shows that we cannot be certain that her true score is above that of the average fourth-grade student. One can be quite confident that her tlUe score is somewhere between 4.4 and 6.0 because 95% of the observed scores fall witllin two standard enurs of the true score. In interpreting individual test scores, however, the use of one standard error of measurement is more common. Thus, a range of 4.8 to 5.6 typically would be used to desa'ibe Mary's test performance.

Theoretical Explanation of the Standard Error of Measurement

- 1. It is assumed that ead1 person has a *true score* on a particular test, a hypothetical value representing a score free of error (true score = 95 on the diagram).
- 2. If a person could be tested repeatedly (Without memory, practice effects, or other changes), the average of the obtained scores would approximate the true score, and the obtained scores would be *approximately normally distributed*  around the true score (see diagram and The Normal Curve and Standard Deviation section of Chapter 19).
- 3. From what is known about the normal distribution curve, approximately 68% of the obtained scores would fall within one standard error of measurement of the person's true score; approximately 95% of the

scores would fall within two standard errors; and approximately 99.7% of the scores would fall within three standard errors (see The Normal CUrve afid the Stafidard Deviation Unit in Chapter 19. The standard error of measurement is the standard deviation of the errors of measurement).

- 4. Although *the true score can never be knawn,* the standard error of measurement can be applied to a person's obtained score to set reasonable limits for locating the tme score (e.g. , an obtained score of 97 plus and minus 5 = 92 to 102).
- 5. These "reasonable limits" provide *confidence bands* for interpreting an obtained score. When the standard error of measurement is small, the confidence band is narrow (indicating high reliability), and thus we have greater confidence that the obtained score is near the true score.

The standard en'or of measurement shows why a test score should be interpreted as a band of scores (called a confidence band) rather than as a specific score. With a large standard error, the band of scores is wide, and we have less confidence in our obtained score. If the standard en'or is small, then the band of scores will be naITOW, and we will have greater confidence that our obtained score is a dependable measure of the characteristic. Viewing an assessment score as a band of scores makes it possible to interpret and use assessment results more intelligently. Apparent differences in scores between individuals and for the same individual over a period of time often disappear when the standard eITor of measurement is considered. A teadler or counselor who is aware of tlle standard eITor of measurement realizes tllat it is impossible to be dogmatic in interpreting minor differences in assessment scores.

The relationship between tlle reliability coefficient and the standard eITor of measurement can be seen in Table 5.6, which presents tlle standard errors of measurement for various reliability coefficients and standard deviations. Notice that as the reliability coefficient increases for any given standard deviation, the standard ennr of measurement decreases. Thus, large reliability coefficients are associated with small measurement errors in specific test scores, and small reliability coefficients are associated with large measurement errors.

If the reliability of an assessment procedure and the standard deviation of the assessment scores are known Table 5.6 can be used to estimate the standard error. In fact, this is the purpose for which the table was developed. All one needs to do to obtain an estimate of the standard error for a given assessment is to enter the column nearest to the reliability coeffident and the row nearest to the standard deviation and read the standard elTor of measurement from the cell for that row and column. For example, a reliability coefficient of 0.90 and a standard deviation of 16 would result in a standard error of 5.1 , which is obtained by going down the 0.90 column to the row in which the standard deviation is 16.

 GUIDELINES : .. Practical Appli cations of the Standard Error of Measurement in Test Interpretation

A confidence band one standard error of measurement above and below the obtained score is commonly used in test profiles to aid in interpreting individual scores and in judging whether differences between scores are likely to be "real differences" or differences caused by chance.

- **1.** Interpreting an individual score. The confidence band indicates "reasonable limits" within which to locate the true score (Mary's true math score probably falls somewhere between 4.8 and 5.6).
- 2. Interpreting tbe difference between two scores from a test battery. When the ends of the bands overlap, there is no "real difference" between scores (MalY's scores in reading and math show no meaningful difference).
- 3. Interpreting the difference between the scores of two individuals on tbe same test. When ends of bands do not overlap, there is a "real difference" between scores (Mary's reading score is higher than 101m's).

Keep several precautions in mind when using Table 5.6 to estimate the standard error of measurement. First, the reliability coeffident and standard deviation must be based on the same group of persons. Second, entering the table with the reliability coefficient and standard deviation nearest to those in the manual gives only an approximation of the standard error of meastu"ement. Third, the table does not take into account the fact that the standard error of measurement varies slightly at different score levels. Within these limitations, however, Table 5.6 provides a simple and quick method for estimating the standard error of measurement and yields an approximation accurate enough for most practical applications of test results.

So far, we have discussed the standard error of measurement and its uses as if the magnitude of measurement errors were always the same regardless of the level of a person's score. Although this common practice works well most of the time, the assumption that the standard error of measurement is a constant throughout the score range does not hold up well for extremely high or extremely low scores. For example , if a multiplechoice test is much too difficult for a student, then that student's score is apt to be based almost entirely on the luck he or she has in guessing the correct answers. Likewise, an assessment requiring extended responses to problems that are far too difficult is apt to result in blank or off-task responses. In either case, the standard error for that student will be conSiderably larger than the standard error for students for whom the test difficulty is more appropriate.

Because the standard errors of measurement tend to be larger for very high and very low scores, some test publishers repOit standard errors of measurement separately for different ranges of scores. The procedures for estimating standard errors of measurement for different score levels are more complicated but really are no different, except that the  numerical value of the standard error used would depend on an individual's test score. This additional infonnation makes it possible to have more accurate score bands for people with extreme scores. Suppose, for example, that for a fourth-grade reading comprehension test, the test manual reported standard errors of measurement for various ranges of GE scores as shown in Table 5.7. From these results, we would recognize that scores indicating performance similar to that of the typical second- or seventh-grade student would be subject to much larger en"Ors of measurement than scores similar to the typical fourth-grade student for whom the test was designed. The wide band for a student with

**TABLE-Standard errors of measurement by score range**

| 7.0-7.9                      | 0.8                           |

Table 5.7


a score of, say, 7.1 (6.3-7.9) would warn us that although the student's performance is clearly well above that of the typical fourth-grade student, we cannot be velY precise about how much higher.

The different standard errors by score level also help in selecting the level of a standardized test that will be most appropriate for a particular group of students. For example, if we know that most of the fourth-grade students in a school have scored far below the national average in earlier grades, then we would know that the fourth-grade level of the test is apt to be too difficult and will result in large standard errors of measurement. In this case, we could expect that using the level of the test designed for third-grade students would result in scores with smaller standard errors of measurement and, thus, provide more dependable results.

The standard error of measurement has two special advantages as a means of estimating reliability. First, the estimates are in the same units as the assessment scores. This makes it possible to indicate directly the margin of error to allow for when interpreting individual scores. Second, the standard error is likely to remain fairly constant from group to group. This is not true of the reliability coefficient, which is highly dependent on the spread of scores in the group assessed. Because the groups on which reliabilities are reported in test manuals will always differ somewhat from the group to be given the test, the greater constancy of the standard error of measurement has obvious practical value. The main difficulty encountered with the standard error occurs when we want to compare two assessments that use different types of scores. Here the reliability coefficient is the only suitable measure.

#### **FACTORS INFLUENCING RELIABILITY MEASURES**

Several factors have been shown to affect the conventional measures of reliability. If sound conclusions are to be drawn, these factors must be considered when interpreting reliability coefficients. We have already seen, for example, that speeded tests will produce a spuriously large reliability coefficient with the internal consistency methods of estimating reliability. We have also noted that test-retest reliability coefficients are influenced by the interval between assessments, with shorter intervals resUlting in larger reliability coefficients. Although we might want to favor the assessment procedure with the largest reliability coeffiCient, we would not do so if we recognized that the reponed coefficient was inflated by factors irrelevant to the consistency of the measurement procedure. Similarly, we might discount the difference between reiiabiiity coefficients reported for two different assessments if the conditions under which they were obtained favored the test with the larger reliability coefficient.

Consideration of the factors influencing reliability not only will help us interpret more wisely the reliability coefficients of standardized tests but also should aid us in constructing more reliable classroom assessments. Although teachers seldom fmd it profitable to calculate reliability coefficients for the assessments they construct, they should be cognizant of the factors influencing reliability to maximize the reliability of their own classroom assessments.

##### Number of Assessment Tasks

In general, the larger the number of tasks on an assessment, the higher its reliability will be. This is because a longer assessment will provide a more adequate sample of the behavior being measured, and the scores are apt to be less distOlted by chance factors, such as special familiarity with a given task or lack of understanding of what is expected on a given task. Suppose that to measure spelling ability, we asked students to spell one word. The results would be patently unreliable. Students who were able to speU the word would be perfect spellers, and students who could not would be complete failures. *U* we happened to select a difficult word, most students would fail; if the word were an easy one, most students would appear to be perfect spellers. The fact that one word provides an unreliable estimate of a student's spelling ability is obvious. It should be equally apparent that as we add more spelling words to the list, we come closer and closer to a good estimate of each cl1ild's spelling ability. Scores based on a large number of spelling words thus are more apt to reflect real differences in spelling ability and therefore to be more stable. By increasing the size of the sample of speUing behaVior, therefore, we increase the consistency of our measurement. A longer test also tends to lessen the influence of cl1ance factors such as guessing. For example, on a 10-item trueand-false test, a student might know seven of the items and guess at the other three. A correct guess on all tfuÂ·ee items would result in a perfect score, and incorrect guesses on all three items would result in only seven correct. This represents a considerable variation in the test score resulting from guessing alone. However, if this same student were taking a test with 100 true-and-false items, the correct guesses would tend to be canceled by incorrect guesses, and the score would be a more dependable indication of actual knowledge.

The fact that a longer assessment tends to provide more reliable results was implied earlier in our discussion of the split-half method. You will recall that when scores from two halves of a test correlated at 0.60, the Speannan- Brown formula estimated the reliability of the scores for the full-length assessment to be 0.75. This is equivalent to estimating the increase in reliability to be expected when the number of assessment tasks is doubled.

The relationship of length to reliability poses a problem for assessments that require an extended time to complete, because the critical feature in the length-reliability relationship is the number of tasks, not the amount of assessment time. If each task requires a full class period or even longer to administer, then it is obvious that increases in the number of tasks have a high cost in terms of student time. Nonetheless, if consistency of performance across different tasks intended to assess a common domain of achievement is low, then multiple tasks will be required to achieve adequate levels of reliability.

There are at least two ways in which the extended time periods required for assessment results to achieve adequate reliability may be justified. First, greater time and expense may be justified when the assessment has major consequences for the individuals being assessed or for society (e.g. , the licensing of physicians). Second, the devotion of extended periods of time to assessments is justified when the assessments are themselves considered good instructional activities that contribute not only to the measurement of achievement but also directly to student learning. The latter justification is likely to be more relevant for assessments in elementary and secondary schools than the former one.

There is one impOltant reselvation in evaluating the influence of the number of tasks on the reliability of the scores: The statements we have been making assume that the assessment will be lengthened by adding tasks of the same quality as those that are already palt of the assessment. Adding 10 spelling words that are so easy that everyone will get them correct or adding 10 spelling words that are so difficult that no one will get them correct will not increase the reliability of the scores on a spelling test. In fact, there would be no influence on the reliability coefficient because such additions would not influence the standing of students relative to others in the group.

In constructing classroom tests or assigning assessment tasks, it is important to keep in mind the influence of the number of questions or tasks on reliability. If only a small number of questions or tasks can be used (because of time limits, the students' ages, or the extended time required to complete each task), then more frequent assessment may be used to obtain a dependable measure of achievement.

In using standardized tests, we should be waly of palt scores based on relatively few items. Such scores are usually low in reliability and of little practical value even when the total test score is high in reliability. Before using such scores, the test manual should be checked for their repolted reliabilities. If these are not repOIted or are very low, the part scores should be ignored, and only the total test score should be used.

##### **Spread of Scores**

As noted earlier, reliability coefficients are directly influenced by the spread of scores in the group assessed. Other things being equal, the larger the spread of scores, the higher the estimate of reliability will be. Because larger reliability coefficients result when individuals stay in the same relative position in a group from one assessment to another, it naturally follows that anything that reduces the possibility of shifting positions in the group also contributes to larger reliability coefficients. In this case, greater differences between the scores of individuals reduce the possibility of shifting positions. Stated another way, enors of measurement have less influence on the relative position of individuals when the differences among group members are large, that is, when there is a wide spread of scores.

This can be easily illustrated without recourse to statistics. Compare the two sets of scores shown in Table 5.8 in terms of the probability that the individuals will remain in the same relative position on a second administration of the assessment. Even a cursory inspection of these scores will show that the persons in Group B are more likely to shift positions on a second administration of the assessment. With a spread of only 10 points from the top score to the bottom score, radical shifts in position can result from changes of just a few points in the scores. 

However in Group A the sscores of the individuals could vary by several points on a second administration of the assessment, with very little shifting in the relative pOSitions of the group members. The large spread of test scores in Group A makes shifts in relative position unlikely and tl1Us gives us greater confidence that these differences among group members are real.

##### **Objectivity**

The objectivity of an assessment refers to tl1e degree to which equally competent scorers obtain the same results. Most standardized tests of aptitude and achievement are high in

| Group A | GroupB |
|---------|--------|
| 95      | 95     |
| 90      | 94     |
| 86      | 93     |
| 82      | 93     |
| 76      | 92     |
| 65      | 91     |
| 60      | 89     |
| 56      | 88     |
| 53      | 86     |
| 47      | 85     |

objectivity. The test items are of the objective type (e.g. , multiple choice), and the resulting scores are not influenced by the scorers' judgment or opinion. In fact, such tests are usually constructed so that they can be accurately scored by trained clerks and scoring machines. When such highly objective procedures are used, the reliability of the test results is not affected by the scoring procedures.

However, for classroom assessments constructed by teachers or performance-based assessments mandated by states and districts, objectivity may piay an important roie in obtaining reliable measures of achievement. In essay testing and assessments requiring judgmental scoring, the results depend, to some extent, on the person doing the scoring. Different persons get different results, and even the same person may get different results at different times. SUcll inconsistency in scoring has an adverse effect on the reliability of the measures obtained, for the test scores now reflect the opinions and biases of the scorer as well as differences among students in the ciuracteristic being measured.

The solution is *not* to use only objective tests or to abandon all methods of assessment that require judgmental scoring. This would have an adverse effect on validity, and, as noted earlier, Validity is the most impOltant characteristic of assessment results. A better solution is to select assessment procedures most appropriate for the learning goals being assessed and then make the assessment procedure as objective as possible. In the use of essay tests, for example, objectivity can be ina'eased by careful phrasing of the questions and by a standard *set* of rules for scoring. Sinlilarly~ the objectivity in scoring of science exhibitions can be ina'eased by establishing clear scoring criteria and carefully training raters. Such increased objectivity will contribute to greater reliability without sacrificing validity.

##### Methods of Estimating Reliability

When examining the reliability coefficients of standardized tests, it is important to consider the methods used to obtain the reliability estimates. In general, the size of the reliability coefficient is related to the method of estimating reliability.

**TABLE-Methods of Estimating Reliability**
| 1. Test-retest method                          | May be larger than with the split-half method if the time interval is short. Coefficients become smaller as the time interval 
|                                                | between tests is increased.                                     |
| 2. Equivalent -forms method (without time      | Coefficients tend to be lower than with the split-half method or the est~r est method using a short time 
|    interval)                                   | interval.                                                                            |
| 3. Equivalent forms method (with time interval)| Coefficients become smaller as the time interval between tests is increased. |
| 4. Split-half method (e.g. odd-even)           | Provides an indication of the internal consistency of a test. Spuriously high estimates are produced for speeded tests. |
| 5. Coefficient alpha                           | Typically provides reliability estimates that are smaller than those obtained by the split-half method when the two halves are 
|                                                | carefully matched. These estimates are also inflated by speed. |
| 6. IntelTater method                           | Provides an indication of the degree to which similar scores are obtained regardless of who does the rating.|
|                                                | Interrater consistency can be increased by using well defined scoring rules and by careful training of raters. |

The variation in the size of the reliability coefficient resulting from the method of estimating reliability is directly attributable to the type of consistency included in each method. Recall tl1at the equivalent-forms method with an intervening time interval took into account the most sources of variation in the test scores and consequently is a more rigorous method of estimating reliability than test- retest, the use of equivalent forms witho ut an intervening time interval, or internal consistency methods. Thus, smaller reliability coefficients can be expected with this method, and it is unfair to compare such reliability coefficients with those obtained by less stringent methods.

At the otl1er extreme, the larger reliability coefficients typically reported for the splithalf method must be accepted cautiously. If speed is an important factor in the testing, split-half reliability coefficients should be disregarded entirely, and other evidence of reliability should be sought.

#### **RELIABILITY OF ASSESSMENTS EVALUATED IN TERMS OF A FIXED PERFORMANCE STANDARD**

In a variety of situations the primary goal of an assessment is to determine whether performance meets a preestablished standard. Teachers may use preestablished standards to assign grades for a test, to make instructional decisions (e.g., review, relearn, or move on), or for placement at the beginning of the year. Criterion-referenced mastety tests are an example of an assessment that is widely used with a preestablished standard. Typically, such tests are designed to provide the basis for a decision regarding the mastery of a set of essential skills and therefore are frequently pitched at a relatively low level of performance. Comparing performance to a fixed standard rather than to the performance of other students, however, need not limit assessment to the testing of low-level skills and minimum levels of pelformance. Indeed, in recent years the emphasis has been on establishing high standards of performance for all SUI dents.

Regardless of the level of the standard, when we use assessments for the purpose of deciding whether performance meets an established standard, our desire for consistency of measurement is similar to that for norm-referenced tests. Thus, we would like an individual's performance to be consistent from (a) one rater to another; (b) one task to another, when all tasks measure the same learning outcome (internal consistency); (c) one time to another, when the learning outcomes are expected to have a reasonable degree of constancy (stability); and (d) one form of an assessment to another, when the forms are intended to measure the same sample of learning tasks (equivalence). However, the focus is more often on whether the perfotmance meets the standard than on the acUlal score.

In addition, because of the specificity of mastery assessments and their close tie to instruction, they may have a narrower range of scores than is typically produced by norm-referenced measures. The focus on mastery decisions and the smaller variability in scores has led to different approaches in evaluating the reliability of mastery assessments.

Given the emphasis on whether a performance meets or fails to meet a standard, the most natural approach to reliability is to evaluate the consistency with which the students are classified as performing above or below the standard. This type of reliability can be readily detennined by computing the percentage of consistent decisions as the result of having performances evaluated by different raters or over two equivalent forms of an assessment. Although a number of more complicated approaches have been suggested, the simple calculation of the percentage of people who are consistently classified is the approach that is encouraged by the *Standards* (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999) for tests that are used to make dichotomous decisions with regard to a standard. With only two categories, however, it becomes more important to take into account the level of agreement that would be expected by chance.

Let's assume that we have given two alternate assessments, each consisting of 10 open-ended mathematics tasks, to a classroom group of 30 students. Each task is scored on a 4-point scale (ranging from 0 for no response or a response that is off task to 3 for a solid solution to the problem with adequate justification). Thus, the range of possible scores on each assessment is from 0 to 30 for each alternate assessment. To meet the standard, a sUldent must obtain a score of at least 20. All students obtaining a score of 20 or higher on both assessments are consistently classified as meeting the standard. All sUldents obtaining a score of 19 or lower on botl1 assessments are consistently classified as failing to meet d1e standard. The remaining students are classified as meeting the standard on one assessment and failing to meet it on the other one. If this latter group of reversals is relatively large, our assessment will obviously be inconsistent in classifying students. The data for such an analysis can be summarized in a two-by-two table like that in Figure 5.4.

|              |                        | Assessment B                             |                   
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|              |                        | Fails to meet standard  | Meets standard |
| Assessment A | Meets standard         | 2                       | 20             |
|              | Fails to meet standard | 7                       | 1              |

 Figure 5.4

A classification of 30 students with respect to a fixed performance standard

By using the infonnation in Figure 5.4, we can compute a percentage of consistency using the following formula.

Meets standard on both forms + Fails to meet standard on both fonllS % Consistency = 100 X Total number in group

. 20 + 7 % ConSIstency = 100 ~ = 90%

chance. The latter figure is computed by completing the following steps: (a) Multiply the propoltion of students who meet the standard on Assessment A (22 of 30 = .733) by the propoltion of students who meet it on Assessment B (21 of 30 = .700). This yields (.733 x .700 = .513). (b) Multiply the propoltion of students who fail to meet the standard on Assessment A (8 of 30 = .267) times the conÂ·esponding figure for Assessment B (9 of 30 = .300). This yields (.267 x .300 = .080). (c) Sum the results of Steps 1 and 2 (.513 + .080 = .593). (d) Convert the result of Step 3 to a percentage by multiplying it by 100. This yields 59.3%, the level of agreement expected by chance given the passing rates on the two assessments. The observed percentage agreement of 90% compares favorably to that expected by clunce.

Similar examples could be given for classifying students into more categories than mastery and nonmastely. On the other hand, the data presented in Table 5.3 and the computations for exact agreement are the extension of the dichotomous mastery- nonll1astery data. As noted for the interrater example, one can report percentage exact agreement or percentage agreement within 1 score point. The percentage agreement expected by chance for exact agreement (or agreement within 1 score point) would be computed in the same way, and comparisons could be made between percentage agreement and percentage expected agreement by chance.

When using mastery testing in the classroom, comparing the percentage agreement with the percentage expected by chance is generally suffident. However, standardized tests may repolt an index-Cohen's kappa-that accounts for the difference between the two numbers. Cohen's kappa is the proportion of agreement tlut is above and beyond what is expected by chance. The formula for Cohen's kappa is

Kappa = (percentage agreement- percentage agreement by chance)/(1000/o agreement by chance)

From the example for mastery-nonmastelY, where the percentage agreement was 90 and the percent agreement by chance was 59.3,

$$\text{Kappa} = (90-59.3) \text{(100 - 59.3)} = 754$$

Therefore, the test was consistent on about three fourths of the classifications above and beyond the 59.3% expected. For this index, any positive value is above and beyond what is ex.'-pected. A value of zero would occur when the example had agreement at 59.3%. Hence, a test that is working at a chance level would have a value of zero even when there is substantial agreement. **In** the extreme, suppose that all students had reacl1ed mastery on two forms of the test. Then the previous computations would lead to an expectation of 100% agreement by chance, and Cohen's kappa would be equal to zero since the test had not done better than what was expected by chance. This provides an example of the problem with having no spread of scores. With a small spread of scores, kappa would be small even with a large percentage of agreement.

Although the percentage of agreement is conceptually simple and easy to compute, it does require two versions of the assessment. This is not a serious shOItcoming, however, because assessments designed to determine whether students meet a standard should allow students who fail to meet the standard an oppOltunity to tty again on an alternate set of assessment tasks. It is seldom wise to permit students who do not meet the performance standard on the first attempt to be reassessed with the identical set of tasks. Procedures have been developed to estimate decision consistency on the basis of the administration of a single test form or set of assessment tasks; however, those procedures are relatively complex and are beyond the scope of this textbook (Subkoviak, 1984). Suffice it to say that they are intended to provide approximations to the percentage of agreement based on equivalent forms from data available from the administration of a single set of assessment tasks.

##### **How High Should Reliability Be?**

The degree of reliability we demand in our educational assessments depends largely on the decision to be made. If we are going to use assessment results to dedde whether to review certain areas of subject matter, we may be willing to use a teacher-made assessment of relatively low reliability. Our dedsion will be based on the scores of the total group, and variation in individual scores will not distort our decision too much. Even if we do en in our decision, no catastrophe will result. The worst that can happen is that the students will get an unnecessalY review of material or will be deprived of a review that may be beneficial to them. On the other hand, if we are going to use an assessment to decide whether to award a high school diploma or a college scholarship, we should demand the most reliable measurement available. Such decisions have important consequences for the lives of the individuals involved.

It is not only the impOItance of a decision that matters, but also whether it is possible to confirm or reverse the judgment at a later time. Dedsion making in education is seldom

a single, final act. It tends to be sequential, starting with rather crude judgments and proceeding tluuugh a series of more refined judgments. In the early stages of decision making, low reliability might be quite tolerable because assessment results are used primarily as a guide to further information gathering. For example, on the basis of classroom assessments of questionable reliability, we might decide that some of our students are having such serious learning difficulties that they need special help. This dedsion can be confirmed or refuted by further assessment with more dependable measures. Opportunities for confirmation and reversai of judgments without serious consequences are aimost aiways present in the early stages of educational dedsion making. Thus, the important thing when reliability is low or unknown is *not* to treat the scores as if they were highly accurate. Make tentative judgments, seek confinning data, and be willing to reverse decisions when wrong.

Thus, when we ask how high reliability should be, several considerations must be taken into account. How important is the decision? Is it one that can be confirmed or reversed at a later time? How far-reaching are the consequences of the action taken? For irreversible decisions that are apt to have great influence on the lives of individual students, we should make stringent demands on the reliability of the assessments we use. For lesser decisions, especially for those that can be later confirmed or reversed without serious consequences, we should be willing to settle for less reliable measures. Teacher-made tests commonly have reliabilities between 0.60 and 0.85, but they are useful for the types of instructional decisions typically made by teachers. Thus, the degree of reliability required depends largely on how confident we need to be about the decision being made. Greater confidence reqUires higher reliability (see the "Guidelines" box).

#### **USABILITY**

In selecting assessment procedures, practical considerations cannot be neglected. Assessments are usually administered and interpreted by teachers with only a minimum of training in measurement. The time available for assessment is almost always limited because assessment is in constant competition with other important activities for time in the school schedule. likewise, the cost of assessment, although a minor consideration, is as carefully scrutinized by budget-consctous administrators as are other expenditures of sell00l funds. These and other factors pertinent to the usability of assessment procedures must be taken into account when selecting assessment procedures. Such practical considerations are especially important when selecting published tests.

##### **Ease of Administration**

If the assessments are to be administered by teaellers or others with limited training, ease of administration is an especially important quality to seek. For this purpose, directions should be simple and clear, subtests should be relatively few, and the time needed for administration of the assessment should not be too great. Administering a test with complicated directions and a number of subtests lasting but a few minutes each is a taxing chore for even an experienced examiner. For a person with little training and experience, such a situation is fraught with possibilities for errors in giving directions, timing, and other aspects of administration that are likely to affect results. SUcll elTors of administration can, of course, have an adverse effect on the validity and reliability of the results.

##### **Time Required for Administration**

With time for assessment at a premium, we always favor the shorter assessment, other things being equal. But in this case, other things are seldom equal because reliability is directly related to tlle length of an assessment. If we attempt to cut down too much on the time alloted to assessment, we may reducre drastically the reliabilty of our source. For example tests designed to fit a nonnal class period usually produce total test scores of satisfactory reliability, but their part scores, obtained from the subtests, tend to be unrelia ble. If we want reliable measures in the areas covered by the subtests, we need to increase our testing time in each area. On the other hand, if we want a general measure in some area, such as verbal aptitude, we can obtain reliable results in 30 or 40 minutes, and there is little advantage in extending the testing time. A safe procedure is to allot as muell time as is necessaty to obtain valid and reliable results and no more. Between 20 and 60 minutes of testing time for each individual score yielded by a published test is probably a fairly good guide.

##### **Ease of Interpretation and Application**

In the final analYSiS, the success or failure of an assessment program is determined by the use made of the assessment results. If they are interpreted correctly and applied effectively, they will contribute to more intelligent educational decisions. On the other hand , if the assessment results are misinterpreted, misapplied, or not applied at all, they will be of little value and may actually be hannful to some individual or group.

Information concerning the interpretation and use of published test results is usually obtained directly from the test manual or related guides. Attention should be directed toward the clarity of score reports, the quality and relevance of norms, and tlle comprehensiveness of the suggestions for applying the results to educational problems. When the test results are to be presented to students or parents, ease of interpretation and application are especially important.

##### Availability of Equivalent or Comparable Forms

For many educational purposes, equivalent forms of the same test are often desirable. Equivalent forms of a test measure the same aspect of behavior by using test items that are alike in content, level of difficulty, and other characteristics. Thus, one form of the test can substitute for the other, making it possible to test students twice in rather close succession without their answers on the first testing influencing their performance on the second testing. The advantage of equivalent forms is readily seen in mastery testing, when we want to eliminate the factor of memory while retesting students on the same domain of achievement. Equivalent forms of a test also may be used to verify a questionable test score. For example, a teacher may believe that a scholastic aptitude or achievement test score is spuriously low for a given student and may easily check this by administering an equivalent form of the test.

CourseSmart

Many tests also provide comparable forms. Published achievement tests, for example, are commonly arranged in a series that covers different grade levels. Although the content and level of difficulty vary, the tests at the different levels are made comparable by means of a common score scale. Thus, it is possible to compare measurements in grade 4 with measurements in grade 6 on a more advanced form of the test. Comparable forms are especially useful in measuring development.

##### Cost of Testing

The factor of cost has been left to the last because it is relatively unimportant in selecting published tests. The reason for discussing it at all is that it is sometimes given far more weight than it deserves. Testing is relatively inexpensive, and cost should not be a major consideration. In large-scale testing programs where small savings per student add up, using separate answer sheets, machine scoring, and reusable booklets will reduce the cost appreciably. But to select one test instead of another because the test booklets are a few cents cheaper is false economy. After all, validity and reliability are the important characteristics to look for, and a test lacking these qualities is too expensive at any price. The contribution that valid and reliable test scores can make to educational decisions means that such tests are always economical in the long run.

#### SUMMARY

Next to validity, reliability is the most important quality to seek in assessment results. Reliability refers to the consistency of scores and other assessment results from one assessment to another. In interpreting and using reliability information, it is important to remember that reliability estimates refer to the results of measurement, that different ways of estimating reliability indicate different types of consistency, that a reliable measure is not necessarily valid, and that reliability is strictly a statistical concept. Reliability estimates are typically reported in terms of a reliability coefficient or the standard error of measurement.

Reliability coefficients are determined by several different methods, and each provides a different measure of consistency. The interrater method requires that the same set of student performances be scored by two or more raters, and it provides an indication of the consistency of scoring across raters. The test-retest method involves giving the same assessment twice to the same group with an intervening interval, and the resulting coeffident provides a measure of stability. The length of the interval between assessments is determined largely by the use to be made of the results. We are interested primarily in reliability coeffidents based on intervals comparable to the periods of time between when the assessment is given and when the scores will be used and interpreted. The equivalent-forms method involves giving two forms of an assessment to the same group in close succession or with an intervening time interval. The first assessment yields a measure of equivalence and the second a measure of stability and equivalence. The equivalent-fonns method provides a rigorous evaluation of reliability because it includes multiple sources of variation in the assessment results. Reliability also can be estimated from a single administration of an assessment, either by correlating the scores on two halves of the assessment or by applying the coefficient alpha formula . Coefficient alpha provides a measure of internal consistency and is easy to apply. However, it is not applicable to speeded tests and provides no information concerning the stability of assessment scores from day to day.

The standard error of measurement indicates reliability in tenns of the amount of variation to be expected in individual scores. It can be computed from the reliability coefficient and the standard deviation, but it is frequently reported directly in test manuals. The standard error is espedally useful in interpreting test scores because it indicates the band of error (called a confidence band) surrounding each score. It also has the advantage of remaining fairly constant from one group to another.

Reliability estimates may vary in accordance with the lengd1 of the assessment, the spread of scores in the group assessed, the difficulty of the assessment tasks, the objectivity of the scoring, and the method of estimting reliability. These factors should be taken into account when appraising reliability information. The degree and type of reliability to be sought in a particular instance depend mainly on the decision being made. For tentative reversible decisions, low reliability may be tolerable; for final, irreversible dedsions, we should make stringent demands on the reliability of our measures.

Conventional measures of reliability depend on scores throughout the range and are influenced by the variability among scores. In assessments designed to assess perfoffi1ance in terms of a fixed standard, the classification of students as meeting or failing to meet the standard is the primary concern. Hence, the consistency of classifications for equivalent assessments is most relevant, and the simple percentage of times that consistent dedsions are made provides the information needed to evaluate reliability of the decision.

In addition to validity and reliability, it is also important to consider d1e usability of tests and other assessment procedures, including such practical features as ease of administration, time required, ease of interpretation and application, availability of equivalent or comparable forms, and cost of testing.

## PART II Classroom Tests and Assessments

### CHAPTER 6: PLANNING CLASSROOM TESTS AND ASSESSMENTS

lassroom tests and assessments play a central role in the evaluation of student learning. They provide relevant measures of many important learning outcomes and indirect evidence concerning others. They make expected learning outcomes explicit to students and parents and show what types of performances are valued. The validity of the information they provide, however, depends on the care that goes into the planning and preparation of tests and assessments.

The main goal of classroom testing and assessment is to obtain valid, reliable, and useful information concerning student achievement. This requires determining what is to be measured and then defining it precisely so that tasks can be constructed that require the intended knowledge, skills, and understanding while minimizing the influence of irrelevant or ancillary skills. It also requires specifying the achievement domain in such a manner that the sample of items and assessment tasks will represent the total domain of achievement tasks giving appropriate emphasis to high-priority objectives. Satisfying these requirements provides the foundation for obtaining results that will be valid for the intended instructional uses.

The likelihood of preparing valid, reliable, and useful classroom tests and assessments is greatly enhanced if a series of steps like that shown in Figure 6.1 is followed.

Specific procedures for constructing each of the various types of test items are described in Chapters 7 through 9. Open-ended essay questions are discussed in Chapter 10 and other types of performance assessment tasks used for measuring complex achievement are described in Chapter 11. The systematic collection of student work into portfolios and the use of those portfolios for specific purposes are described in Chapter 12. Chapter 13 describes the use of observational techniques, peer appraisals, and self-report

teclmiques to assess learning outcomes and student development. Chapter 14 is concerned with assembling, administering, and appraising classroom tests and assessments. Chapter 15, the last cl1apter in this section, describes approaches to grading and reporting.

#### **THE PURPOSE OF CLASSROOM TESTING AND ASSESSMENT**

Classroom tests and assessments can be used for a variety of instructional purposes. These can be best described in teons of their location in the instructional process, which closely parallels the types of assessment described in Chapter 3.

##### **Pretesting**

Tests and assessments may be given at the beginning of an instructional segment (e.g., unit or course) to determine (a) whether students have the prerequisite skills needed for the instruction (to determine readiness) or (b) to what extent students have already achieved the objectives of the planned instruction (to determine student placement or modification of instruction).

Readiness pretests are typically limited in scope. For example, a pretest in algebra might be confined to aritrunetic operations and concepts, a pretest in physics might consist of basic physical concepts or prerequisite skills in algebra, and a pretest in beginning German might be limited to knowledge of English grammar. In addition to being confined to a limited domain, pretest items tend to have a relatively low level of difficulty. Published readiness tests are available at the primary school level in the basic skill areas, but most teachers must develop their own readiness pretests. These tests serve as a basis for remedial work or for adaptation of instructional plans.

Pretests for determining the extent to which students have already achieved the objectives of the planned instruction are no different from the tests used to measure the outcomes of instruction. Thus, a test designed to measure final achievement in a course or unit may be given at the beginning to measure entry performance on the objectives. In this case, the final test or assessment should, of course, not be the same test used in pretesting but an equivalent form of it.

##### Testing and Assessment During Instruction

Tests and assessments given during instruction provide the basis for formative assessment. They are used to monitor learning progress, detect misconceptions, encourage students to study, and provide feedback to students and teachers. Teachers commonly call these formative tests learning tests, practice tests, quizzes, unit tests, and the like. These tests and assessments typically cover some predefined segment of instruction (e.g., a chapter or particular set of skills) and thus encompass a rather limited sample of learning outcomes. The mix of types of test items and more complex performance assessment tasks needs to be selected with care to ensure that the full range of critical instructional objectives is assessed and to ensure that high-priority but possibly difficult-to-assess objectives are adequately represented in the assessment. Ideally, the tests and assessments will be constructed in such a way that corrective prescriptions can be given for learning objectives that are yet to be achieved. When most students fail a set of items or perform poorly on an extended performance task, a group review may be applicable. When a small number of students perform in ways that show a lack of understanding of critical concepts, alternative methods of study may be prescribed (e.g., special tutoring, reading assignments, practice exercises, and the like).

Persistent learning difficulties may require the use of diagnostic tests. For this type of testing, a number of test items are needed in each specific area, with some slight variation from item to item. In diagnosing students' difficulties in adding whole numbers, for example, it would be necessary to include addition problems containing various number combinations, some requiring carrying and some not, to pinpoint the specific types of errors being made. Diagnostic testing is a highly specialized area that has been somewhat neglected in educational measurement. There are some published diagnostic tests, but these are primarily in the basic skills area. In other areas, teachers have to depend more heavily on the diagnostic features of formative tests or prepare their own diagnostic tests and assessments.

##### End-of-Instruction Testing and Assessment

At the end of a segment of instruction (e.g., unit or course), our main interest is in measuring the extent to which the intended learning outcomes and performance standards have been achieved. Although these end-of-instruction tests and assessments are used

 Table 6.1

The basic types of classroom tests and assessments

(This item omitted from WebBook edition)

primarily for summative assessment (e.g., to certify accomplishment or assign grades), they can also serve other functions. End-of-unit tests can be used for feedback to students, encouraging students to undertake more challenging advanced work, assigning of remedial work, and assessing instlUction as well as for grading purposes. In fact, they can serve the functions of both formative and summative assessment and in some cases serve as a pretest for the following unit (e.g., where the units are sequenced, as in math). Endof-course tests provide a broad survey of student learning over all the intended outcomes of a course. In addition to their use in grading, tests can also provide information for evaluating instlUctlonai effectiveness. A summary of the various types of classroom tests is presented in Table 6.1.

#### **DEVELOPING SPECIFICATIONS FOR TESTS AND ASSESSMENTS**

To ensure that classroom tests and assessments measure a representative sample of instructionally relevant tasks, it is impoltant to develop specifications that can guide the selection of test items and assessment tasks. When preparing a brief learning test on a

limited area (e.g., spelling or capitalization), a simple listing of specific tasks, with an indication of the number of items measuring each task, may suffice. For most testing purposes, however, more elaborate specifications are needed. One device that has been widely used for *this* purpose is a two-way chart, called a table of specifications (or test blueprint).

##### **Building a Table of Specifications**

Building a table of spedfications involves (a) preparing a list of instructional objectives, (b) outlining the course content, and (c) preparing the two-way chart. These steps are illustrated here for a weatller unit in a middle school earth science class.

Preparing the List of InstmctiooaJ Objectives. Using the procedure for stating instructional objectives described in Chapter 3, the following list of general objectives and specific learning outcomes was prepared for the weather unit. Although the list is not exhaustive, it illustrates bOtll the method of stating the objectives and the desired amount of detail. If this weather unit were being taught at a lower grade level, our objectives would be defined by fewer and simpler specific learning outcomes; at a higher grade level, more complex learning outcomes would be induded.

##### Instmctional Objectives for a Weather Unit

	- 6.3. Measures relative humidity

The list of objectives is limited to those outcomes that can be measured by a classroom assessment. The fOlm of the test question or assessment task may valy as a function of the outcome. Outcomes involving verbs such as *identifies, distinguishes,* or *matches* are effectively and efficiently measured by multiple-choice or otl1er types of objective test items. Those involving verbs such as *names* or *draws* are readily measured by simple supplytype items where students are asked to "fill in the blank." Outcomes using verbs such as *describes* or *explains* can be measured by skillfully constructed objective items but are often more readily and better measured by essay questions. Those involving verbs such as *constructs, delivers,* or *measures* most clearly require performance assessment tasks. The listed objectives do not include affective outcomes (e.g., demonstrating scientific attitude). A more elaborate evaluation plan for a weather unit might contain a listing of all relevant outcomes with an indication of how eacl1 is to be assessed.

Outlining the Instructional Content. The second step in preparing a table of specifications is to make an outline of the instructional content. The instructional objectives describe the types of performance the students are expected to demonstrate; the instructional content indicates the area in which each type of performance is to be shown. The amount of detail to include in me content outline is somewhat arbitrary, but the outline should be detailed enough to ensure an adequate sampling of content and proper interpreta.tion of the results. The following list of topiCS and subtopics for a weather unit illustrates an adequate outline for test and assessment preparation.

	- 2. Formation of fronts
	- 3. Weather related to fronts
	- 4. Symbols for fronts

Preparing the Two-Way ChaIt. The final step in building a table of spedfications is to prepare a two-way chart that relates the instructional objectives to the instructional content, thus spedfying the nature of the sample of test items and assessment tasks. An example of the chart for our junior high weather unit is presented in Table 6.2. This table indicates both the total number of test items and assessment tasks and the percentage of items may be suffiCient, but the percentages are useful in determining the amount of emphasis to give to eadl area.

Table 6.2 is limited to those objectives that can be measured with a classroom test with objective or restricted-response essay items. It excludes those objectives requiring petformance (e.g., 4.7, an oral presentation; 5.6, constructing a weather map; and 6.1 through 6.3, using weather instruments). Thus, for comprehensive coverage, the classroom test would need to be supplemented by a set of petformance assessment tasks. The relative weight to be given to the results of the petformance assessments and the classroom test in the assignment of course grades should be determined in accordance with the relative importance of the objectives. It is critical that important objectives that cannot be assessed by the classroom test be identified so that plans for assessing the achievement of those objectives can be made. In this example, a simple list of five perfomlance assessment tasks corresponding to instructional objectives 4.7, 5.6, 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, together with a plan for the relative weight to be given to the scores on those tasks and the classroom test, would suffice.

Table 6.2 was prepared using the following steps.

- 1. List the general instructional objectives across the top of the table.
- 2. List the major content areas down the left side of the table.
- 3. Determine what proportion of the test items should be devoted to each objective and each content area.

The bottom row of Table 6.2 shows that 10% of the items are to be devoted to knowledge of basic tenns, 10% to knowledge of weather symbols, 1()O/o to knowledge of specific facts, 50% to understanding influence of weather factors, and 20% to interpretation of weather maps. Similarly, the column on the far right shows that 15% of the items are to be concerened with air pressure, 25% with wind, and soon down the column. Typically these percentages are assigned first to indicate the relative emphasis to be given to each objective and each content area. The total number of items for each area is then determined. For example, because this is to be a 60-item test, 6 of the items (1()%) are to measure knowledge of basic tenus, and 9 of the items (15%) are concerned with air pressure. Thus, the total number of items is computed and listed across the bottom and down the right-hand side of the chart. These numbers are then used as a guide to assign test items to each celL For example, 2 itelns (approximately 33% of 6) have been assigned to the cell in the lower-left-hand corner, indicating that the test will contain 2 items measuring knowledge of terms concerning clouds. The assignment of items to each cell is not strictly a matter of following the percentages, however. Some cells may be left blank, as shown in the chain, because items in tllOse areas are inappropriate. Similarly, some cells may receive a larger number of items because tlley correspond to more important instructional objectives, and consequently the learning tasks for that cell may have received greater emphasis in teaching. In the example, 10 of the 60 items would be allocated to assessing a student's understanding of wind on weather fonnation, whereas only a single item would be included to measure knowledge of a specific fact about wind. Such a dispropoltionate allocation is appropriate if it is consistent with the intended and actual instmctional priority given to understanding the influences of wind on weather formation. The table of specifications provides guidance in constructing the test. The actual test may deviate slightly from those specifications for specific cells, but the number of items in tlle cells of the table should approximate the desired distribution and should add up to the total number of items indicated for eacll column and row.

The final distribution of items in the table of spedfications combined with pelformance assessments that are not pan of the classroom tests should reflect the emphasis given during the instruction. Objectives considered more impoltant by the teacher should be allotted more test items. This applies not only to the items within the classroom test but also to performance assessment tasks. The weight given to the performance of such assessment tasks should reflect the importance of the objective. Similarly, areas of content receiving more instruction time should be allocated more test items and assessment tasks. Although the decisions involved in making the table are somewhat arbitrary and the process is time consuming, the preparation of a table of test specifications, together with a listing of performance assessment tasks needed to supplement the test, is one of the best means for ensuring that the total set of test items and assessment tasks will measure a representative sample of instructionally relevant objectives. As noted in Chapter 4, this provides content-related evidence that the test will provide a valid measure of the intended learning outcomes. The effon that goes into developing specifications also makes it much easier to prepare the test once the plan is developed.

##### **Other Examples of Specifications**

Because of its broad coverage, a table of specifications is especially useful in constnlcting a test or assessment over a unit or course. Here the table ensures that each of the diverse types of learning outcomes will receive appropriate emphasis in the test. Whether a table of specifications is useful in constmcting a test over a more limited area, however, depends on the scope of learning outcomes to be covered by the test. If the domain of tasks is very  limited, sucl1 as "addition of fractions with the same denominator," a table of specifications might be unnecessaly. Here we could simply list all, or nearly all, of the specific tasks encompassed by this learning outcome, as follows:

- Adds two fractions with same denominator where the answer is less than 1 0 / 3 + 1/3).
- Adds two fractions with same denominator where the answer equals 1 0 / 3 + 2/ 3).
- Adds two fractions with same denominator where the answer is greater than 1 (2/3 + 2/3),
- Adds two fractions with same denomina tor and reduces answer to lowest terms (4/6 + 4/6).
- Adds more than two fractions with same denominator and reduces answer (1 / Q + <:; / Q + '< / Q'\ \. <sup>I</sup>v . **/1 V . VI V.I'**

A list of learning tasks such as this specifies quite clearly the precise nature of the performance involved in "the addition of fractions with the same denominator." We could obtain a fairly representative sample of such tasks by sin1ply constmcting five or more items for each task, using various number combinations.

If our mathematics test were to cover a slightly larger achievement domain, say, "addition of fractions," we might now find a table of specifications quite useful. An illustration of such a table for a 50-item test is shown in Table 6.3. The use of such a table does not mean, of course, that we should not make the type of detailed breakdown we did for

**TABLE-Table of specifications for a 50-item test on addition of fractions**

"addition of fractions with the same denominator. " Such a detailed listing of tasks aids in teacl1ing, in detecting learning errors, and in constmcting test items. The table of spedfications, however, supplements such lists by specifying the sample of tasks to be included in the test. As noted earlier, this provides greater assurance that the intended learning outcomes will be measured in a balanced manner.

A simple list such as that given for "addition of fractions with the same denominator or specifications such as those shown in table 6.3 can be readily constructed for the  operational skills aspects of addition of fractions. It is often more difficult, however, to construct specifications that do justice to objectives of understanding concepts or the ability to apply the concepts in novel settings. This is made clear even with the relatively narrow topic of fractions by considering the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standard 12: Fractions and Decimals for Grades K-4. Among other things, that standard states that students should "develop concepts of fractions, mixed numbers, and decimals" and "apply fractions and decimals to problem situations" (NCTM, 1989).

Using Standard 12 as a statement of instructional goals for fractions, the assessment would clearly need to include tasks that measure students' conceptual understanding of fractions and their ability to apply fractions in novel problem situations. To ensure the inclusion of such tasks, understanding concepts and applications of fractions should be included in the table of specifications. Although the specifications in Table 6.3 might be appropriate for one segment of instmction, specifications similar to those in Table 6.4 might be more appropriate at another stage of instruction.

Because Table 6.4 is expressed in terms of the percentage of points associated with each combination of objectives and content area, a decision would need to be made about the total number of points. Because the points are to be obtained from a combination of a classroom test and a set of performance assessment tasks, additional specifications would also be needed to allocate the points to the different sources of information. A single performance assessment task involving relationships between decimals and fractions, for example, might be scored on a 5-point scale. Assuming a total

of 100 point5, that task would represent half the targeted total of 10 points for that cell. The other 5 points might then be allocated to five shOit -answer test items.

##### Using a One-Way Classification System

For test5 in some areas, a one-way classification of items may be all that is needed. In planning for a reading test, for example, a list of the reading skills and the number of test items for measuring each skill may be suffident for specifying what the test is to measure. The content (e.g., passages read) may vary from time to time, but the skill outcomes remain fairly constant. Thus, a master list of skills can be prepared for use with various types of reading mate rial. An example of such a list is presented in Table 6.5.

It should be noted that each skill in Table 6.5 is stated in specific performance terms and that 10 items are used to measure each skill. This provides for QÂ·iterion-referenced interpretation. Although the material to be read is not included in the specifications, it will, of course, need to be carefully selected in terms of interest and readability level. See the "Checklist" box.

#### **SELECTING APPROPRIATE TYPES OF ITEMS AN D ASSESSMENT TASKS**

It is common to make a distinction between classroom tests that consist of objective test items and performance assessments that require students to construct responses (e.g., write an essay) or perform a particular task (e.g., measure air pressure). Objective test items are highly stmctured and require the students to supply a word or two or to select the conect answer from alternatives. They are called objective because they have a single right or best answer that can be determined in advance. Performance assessment tasks, such as essay questiOns, permit the student to organize and construct the answer in essay fonn. Other types of performance assessment tasks may require the student to use equipment, generate hypotheses, make observations, COnstlUct something (e.g., a mode!), or perform for an audience (e.g., give a speech). For most perfonnance assessment tasks, there is not a single right or best response-there may be a variety of responses that are considered excellent. Problem identification may, in fact, be an important part of the task, and, of course, there may be multiple ways of structuring the problem and organizing a response. Expert judgment is required to score the performances. There is no

conflict between these highly constrained objective items and the mud1 less constrained performance assessment tasks. For some instl1Jctionai purposes, objective items may be most efficient, whereas for others, perfonnance assessments may prove most satisfactOlY. Each approach should be used where most appropriate, with appropriateness determined by the learning outcomes to be measured and by the advantages and limitations of each approach.

##### **The** Objective Test **Item**

Various forms and uses of objective items are discussed in greater detail in Chapters 7 to 9. Here we provide only a quick overview.

The great variety of different types of objective test items can be classified into those that reqUire the student to supply the answer and those that require the student to select the answer from a given number of alternatives. These two general classes are commonly divided into basic types of objective test items, illustrated in the accompanying examples.

- A When they win, they are happy.
- Â® Politics are hard to understand.
- C The majority is always right.
- D One or the other is to be elected.

In addition to these basic types of objective test items are numerous modifications and combinations of types. However, little is to be gained from listing all the possible variations, as many are unique to palticular objectives or subject-matter areas. Some of the more common variations used to measure understanding, thinking skills, and otl1er complex learning outcomes are illustrated later. An understanding of ilie principles of test constmction and t11e principles that apply to each of the specific types of objective test items should enable teachers to make adaptations iliat best fit their particular purposes.

The various types of objective test items have one feature in COllunon that distinguishes them from performance assessment tasks: They present students with a highly stmctured task that limits the type of response they can make. To obtain ilie correct answer, students must demonstrate ilie specific knowledge, understanding, or skill called for in the item; they are not free to redefine the problem or to organize and present t11e answer in their own words. They must select one of several alternative answers or supply the correct word , number, or symbol. This structuring of the problem and restriction on the method of responding contribute to objective scoring that is qUick, easy, and accurate. On the negative side, this same stmcturing makes ilie objective test item inappropriate for measuring the ability to formulate problems and choose an approad1 to solving them or the ability to select, organize, and integrate ideas. To measure such outcomes, we must depend on performance assessment tasks. Performance assessment tasks are also needed to measure a student's ability to engage in hands-on activities, SUd1 as conducting an experiment, measuring predpitation, designing and conducting a survey, or creating an alt object.

Because written essays are the most commonly used form of perfonnance assessment tasks, it is worth focusing on essay questions before considering other types of performance assessment tasks. The essay question is commonly viewed as one item type. A useful classification, however, is one based on the amount of freedom of response the student is allowed. This includes extended-response essay questions, in which students are given almost complete freedom in making their responses, and restricted-response essay questions, in which the nature, length, or organization of the response is limited. These types of essay questions are illustrated as follows:

#### EXAMPLES **EXTENDED-RESPONSE ESSAY QUESTIONS**

- Describe what you think the role of the federal government should be in maintaining a stable economy in the United States. Include specific policies and programs and give reasons for your proposals.
- Explain how clouds are formed and how they affect weather and climate.
- Predict the effects that an increase in interest rates would have on consumers, producers, and investors. Include an explanation of how your predictions follow from fundamental economic principles.

#### **RESTRICTED-RESPONSE ESSAY QUESTIONS**

- State two advantages and two disadvantages of maintaining high tariffs on goods from oiner counines.
- Name two types of clouds and describe the characteristics that distinguish them.
- The percentage of the workforce that is unemployed increased following an increase in interest rates. Briefly explain the relationship.

Extended-response essay questions pennit students to decide which facts they think are most pertinent, to select their own method of organization, and to write as mucl1 as seems necessary for a comprehensive answer. Thus, such questions tend to reveal the ability to evaluate ideas, to relate them cohere ntly, and to express them succinctly. To a lesser extent, tlley also reflect individual differences in attitudes, values, and creative ability.

Although extended essay questions are valuable for measuring complex skills and understanding of concepts and principles, they have tllree weaknesses: (1) They are inefficient for measuring knowledge of factual material because the questions are so extensive that only a small sample of content can be included in anyone assessment; (2) the scoring criteria are not as appare nt to the student because it is not listed with the item; and (3) scoring is difficult and apt to be unre liable because the responses include an alTay of facUlal information of varying degrees of cOlTectness, organized with valy ing degrees of coherence, and expressed with varying degrees of legibility and conciseness. Hence, extended essay questions are best used to assess more complex cognitive objectives involving application, evaluation, or the ability to express ideas in coherent, persuasive ways.

Restricted-response essay questions minimize some of the weaknesses of extendedresponse essay questions. Restricting the type of response makes it easier to measure knowledge of factual material, makes the scoring more clear to the student, and reduces somewhat the difficulty of the scoring. On the other hand, the more highly structured task presented by the restricted-response essay questions makes them less effective as a measure of the ability to select, organize, and integrate ideas. Furthermore, if the restrictions become too tight, the questions reduce to nothing more than a supply-type item.

Neither extended-response essay questions nor restricted-response essay questions can serve all purposes equally. The type of essay question to use in a palticular situation depends primarily on the learning outcomes to be measured and, to a lesser extent, on such practical considerations as the difficulty of scoling.

##### Other Types of Performance Assessment

There are many other types of performance assessment tasks. Examples include oral presentations; construction of graphs, diagrams, or models; use of equipment or scientific instruments; typing; and playing a musical instrument. Tasks are selected so that the perfonnance corresponds as closely as possible to an important instructional objective.

A distinction can be made between restricted-response pelformance tasks and extended-response perfonnance tasks. These types are illustrated as follows:

#### EXAMPLES EXTENDED-RESPONSE PERFORMANCE TASKS

Prepare a weather report for another state and make an oral presentation of the report to the dass using appropriate visual displays.

Take four strips of different-colored paper that are each 6 inches in length. Cut the white strip into two parts of equal length, the yellow strip into three parts of equal length , the green strip into four parts of equal length, and the blue strip into six parts of equal length. Compare the lengths when different numbers of pieces of strips are put together (e.g., two pieces of the yellow strip compared to three pieces of the blue strip) and describe the relationship between corresponding fractions (e.g., 213 and 3/6).

#### RESTRICTEDÂ· RESPONSE PERFORMANCE TASKS

Measure and record the relative humidity.

Take a number of 1-inch-square pieces of paper to use. Assuming each square represents the fraction 1/4, construct a whole. (Can be repeated using different fractions.)

The virtues and limitations of extended- and restricted-response performance tasks are much the same as those listed for extended- and restricted-response essay questions. The freedom provided by the extended-response pelfonnance task enables students to display such impOitant skills as problem solving, planning, organization, integration, and creativity. Questions of this type also provide an opportunity to obselve student performance in more realistic contexts than are possible with objective test items. On the other hand, they are time consuming to administer and difficult to score.

Restricted-response performance tasks are generally easier to score and reqUire less time than extended-response performance tasks. However, they are generally less suited for measuring the higher-order skills measured by extended-response performance tasks.

##### Comparative Advantages of Objective Test Items and Performance Assessment Tasks

Both objective test items and performance assessment tasks can provide valuable evidence concerning student achievement. Each has advantages and limitations that make it more appropriate for some purposes than for others. A comparison of the relative ments of objective item tests and performance assessments is presented in Table 6.6. In considering the comparative advantages of objective-item tests and performance assessments, we must be careful not to fall into either/or thinking, that is, to use either objective items or performance assessment tasks. It is frequently better to use both, with each measuring the paticular learning outcomes for which it is best suited. This should also have a desirable influence on student learning because in preparing for such tests students must attend to the specific types of learning outcomes measured by objective items as well as the synthesis and integrated performance outcomes measured by performance assessment tasks.

##### Selecting the Most Appropriate Types of Items and Tasks

A basic principle in selecting the type of test item and assessment task to use is to select the item type that provides the most direct measure of the intended learning outcome. If, for example, the intended learning outcome is writing, naming, listing, or speaking, the task should require the students to supply the answer. If the outcome involves the use of laboratory equipment to solve a problem, nothing short of an actual laboratory performance task will suffice. On the other hand, if the task calls for idntifying a correct answer, a selection-type item should be used. In those cases where the specific learning outcome does not make clear which item type to use, selection-type items would be favored because of the greater control over the student's response and the objectivity of the scoring. However, the intended learning outcome may also require more complex items or direct measures of performance. The following items were prepared for the weather unit discussed earlier. Note how each type of objective item provides a direct measure of the outcome it was designed to measure.

#### EXAMPLE SHORT-ANSWER ITEMS

Specific Learning Outcome: Writes a definition of each term.

Directions: Write a one-sentence definition of each of the following terms.

- 1. Weather
- Courses 2. Humidity
	- 3. Occluded front

Specific Learning Outcome: Names the instrument used for measuring each weather element.

#### PERFORMANCE TASKS

Specific Learning Outcome: Measures and records changes in air pressure.

Directions: Measure the air pressure on 5 consecutive days at the same time of day and graph it to see the changes. Explain the reasons for the changes that occur.

In deciding which selection-type item to use, a conunon practice is to use the multiple-choice item if it will measure the learning outcome as directly as the other two types. The use of true-false items is typically most valuable in those special instances where there are only two possible alternatives (e.g., distinguishing between correct and incorrect procedures). The matching item is a specialized form of the multiple-choice item and should be used only where a series of homogeneous things are to be related (e.g. , dates and events, authors and books, or instruments and uses). The multiplechoice item is favored for most other selection-type tasks because the use of four or five alternatives reduces the chances of guessing the answer and provides clues to students' misunderstandings. See Appendix G for other examples of how to relate test items to intended learning outcomes.

Whether a test item or an assessment task actually measures the particular performance called for by a specific learning outcome depends, of course, to a large extent on the skill with which the test item or assessment task is constructed. No amount of skill, however, will enable LIS to develop a valid test or assessment of achievement if the items or tasks selected for use are inappropriate for measuring the intended outcomes.

#### **CONSIDERATIONS IN PREPARING RELEVANT TEST ITEMS AND ASSESSMENT TASKS**

The construction of items and tasks should be preceded by a series of preliminary steps. First, the purpose of the test or assessment should be determined. Second, a set of specifications should be developed. Third, the most appropriate types of test items and performance assessment tasks should be selected. Finally, items and tasks should be constructed in accordance with the specifications developed during the preceding steps. The rules for constructing ead1 type of objective item are discussed in Chapters 7 through 9, and rules for constructing performance assessments are discussed in Chapters 10 and 11. Here we focus on general considerations involved in preparing relevant objective items and assessment tasks.

##### Matching Items and Tasks to Intended Outcomes

Classroom tests and assessments are most likely to provide a valid measure of the instructional objectives if the test items and assessment tasks are designed to measure the EXAMPLE Specific Learning Outcome: Identifies the function of a given body structure.

 Relevant Test Item:

What is the function of the kidneys?

- (A) Eliminate waste products
- B Improve the circulation of blood
- C Maintain respiration
- D Stimulate digestion

Thus, the preparation of relevant test items and assessment tasks means analyzing the performance described in the specific learning outcome (i.e., "Identifies the function of . . ") and constructing a test item or assessment task that calls forth that performance (i.e., "What is the function of . . . ?"). Note that the specific learning outcome defines the type of response the student is expected to make, but it does not indicate the specific course content (i.e., kidney) the student is to identify. Keeping the learning outcome free of specific course content makes it possible to key the intended response to various areas of content. For example, students could be asked to identify the function of the heart, the lungs, the muscles, or any other body structure pertinent to the course's content. The desired student performance stated in the specific learning outcome can be keyed to each specific area of content by means of the table of specifications.

In some cases, it may be desirable to prepare a general item pattern as an intermediate step between the specific learning outcome and the test item. A general item pattern for our illustrative test item would be as follows:

 EXAMPLE What is the function of ... ?

An item pattern such as this could be completed adding the name of any body structure and using it as a short-answer question or by listing appropriate alternatives and using it as a multiple-choice item. Thus, using the item pattern as a guide, we could generate large numbers of relevant test items for this particular learning outcome. This procedure is especially useful when a file of test items is being prepared or when more than one form of the test is needed (e.g., pretesting, posttesting, and retesting).

When item patterns are used as a guide to test construction, they can be arranged by general type of learning outcome.

 EXAMPLES Knowledge Outcomes

- 1. What is the name of ... ?
- 2. What is the location of ... ?
- 3. What are the characteristics of ... ?
- 4. What is the function of ... ?

 Understanding Outcomes

- 1. What is the reason for . . . ?
- 2. What is the relationship between ... ?
- 3. Which of these is an example of . . . ?
- 4. Which of these best summarizes ... ?

 Application Outcomes

- 1. What method would be best for .. . ?
- 2. What steps should be followed to construct . . . ?
- 3. Which of these indicates correct application of ... ?
- 4. Which of these solutions is correct for . . . ?

Item patterns such as these should not, of course, be developed haphazardly. Rather, they should be derived from the specific learning outcomes they represent. Although it usually will not be possible to develop item patterns for all outcomes, listing them will help generate pools of relevant test items. The test construction time saved by using such a list can then be used to construct more effective items for those areas in which general item patterns are not feasible.


##### Obtaining a Representative Sample of Items and Tasks

A test or assessment, no matter how extensive, is almost always a sample of the many possible test items or tasks that could be included. We expect students to know thousands of facts, but we can test for only a limited number of them; we expect students to develop understanding applicable to innumerable situations, but we can test application to only a limited number of situations; and we expect students to develop thinking skills that will enable them to solve a variety of problems, but we can test their problem-solving ability with only a limited number of problems. In each area of content and for each specific learning outcome, then, we merely select a sample of student performance and accept it as evidence of achievement in that area. We assume that the students' responses to our selected set of items and tasks are typical of what their responses would be to other items and tasks drawn from the same area. This means, of course, that our limited samples must be selected in such a way that they provide as representative a sample as possible in each of the various areas for which the test or assessment is being developed.

Our sampling is most likely to be representative when the preparation of a test or assessment is guided by a carefully prepared set of specifications. Unless a table of specifications or some similar device is used as a guide in construction, there is a tendency to overload the test with items measuring knowledge of isolated facts and to neglect more complex learning outcomes. In social studies, for example, it is not uncommon to include a disproportionately large number of items that measure knowledge of names, dates, places, and the like. In science, defining terms and naming structures and functions are commonly overemphasized. In mathematics, computational skill is frequently the only learning outcome measured. In language arts and literature, the identification of pans of speech, literary characters, authors, and the like is frequently too prominent. These learning outcomes are stressed not because we think that knowledge of isolated facts is more important than understanding, applications, interpretations, and various thinking skills. Rather, they usually receive undue prominence because we find it easier to construct this kind of test item. Without a carefully developed test plan, ease of construction all too frequently becomes the dominant criterion in constructing test items. *As* a consequence, the test measures a limited and biased sample of learning tasks and neglects many learning outcomes of greater importance.

Supplementing objective test questions with performance assessment tasks is one means of ensuring that broader learning objectives are given proper attention. However, it is inefficient to rely only on performance assessments to measure more complex understandings. For this reason, it is important to find ways of constructing objective test items that do more than measure factual knowledge. One approach to this goal of measuring complex achievement is tlu"Ough the use of interpretive exercises. This approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

Number of Items and Tasks. The number of items and tasks is, of course, an important perfOlmance tasks are detennined when the set of specifications is built and depend on such factors as the purpose of measurement, the types of test items and assessment tasks used, the age of the students, and the level of reliability needed for effective use of the test or assessment results. Thus, an assessment over a third-grade social studies unit might contain 30 objective items, whereas a survey test over a 10th-grade social studies course might contain more than 100 objective items and several essay questions. Although there are no hard-and-fast rules for determining the number of items and tasks, an important consideration from a sampling standpoint is the number of items or tasks devoted to each specific area being measured. We want our tests and assessments to be long enough to provide an adequate sampling of each objective and each content area. *As* a rule of thumb, it is desirable when constructing a unit test to use at least 10 objective test items to measure each specific learning outcome. This number, however, might be lowered to as few as five if the task is extremely limited (e.g., "Adds two single-digit numbers" or "Capitalizes proper names") and the students are to supply tl1e answers rather than to select them. For a survey test, where the sample of test items typically covers a broad area and emphasis is on the total score, using several objective test items for each specific learning outcome and 10 or more for each general objective probably would be sufficient.

Special problems of sampling arise when complex learning outcomes are being measured, because this requires more elaborate objective-type items (referred to as interpretive exercises) and performance assessment tasks. Both interpretive exercises and performance assessment tasks require considerable administration time, but a single test item or assessment task is still inadequate for measuring an intended outcome. One exercise calling for the interpretation of graphs, for example, is not sufficient to measure adequately the ability to interpret graphs. The nature of the data or the type of graph may be the most influential factor in determining whether it is interpreted properly. When several graphs are used, the effect of such factors is minimized, and we obtain a more representative sample of the ability to interpret graphs.

A similar situation occurs with the use of performance assessment tasks. The performance of any single task depends too heavily on the particular sample of infonnation called for by the task, and thus the only feasible solution is to confine eacl1 assessment of complex outcomes to a rather limited area (e.g., graph interpretation or problem solving) and to assess more often. In any event, our aim should be to obtain as representative a sample of student pelformance as possible in eacl1 area to be assessed. Other things being equal, the greater the number of test items or assessment tasks, the greater the likelihood of an adequate sample and the more reliable the results.

##### **Eliminating Irrelevant Barriers to the Performance**

As was discussed in Chapter 4, the validity of the assessment may be undermined by the influence of construct-irrelevant fa ctors or abilities that are ancillary to the intent of the assessment. Hence, care must be taken when constructing items or assessment tasks to eliminate any constmct-irrelevant factors that might prevent students from performing their best. If sntdents have achieved a palticular learning outcome (e.g., knowledge of terms), we would want them to answer correctly those test items that measure the attainment of that learning outcome. We would be vely unhappy (and so would they) if they answered such test items incorrectly merely because the sentence structure was too complex, the vocabulary too difficult, or the type of response called for unclear. These factors, which are extraneous to the central purpose of the measurement, limit and modify the students' responses and prevent them from showing their true levels of achievement. Such factors are as unfair as determining a person's running ability when an ankle is sprained. Although a measure of running ability would be obtained, the performance would be restricted by a factor we did not intend to include in our measurement.

One way to eliminate factors that are eA1:raneous to the purpose of a measurement is to be certain that all students have the prerequisite skills and abilities needed to make the response. These have been called enabling behaviors because they enable the student to make the response but are not meant to be aÂ·itical factors in the measurement. That is, they are a necessary but not sufficient condition for responding correctly or performing a task well. Probably the most important enabling behavior in objective testing is reading skill. In written performance assessments, skill in written expression is an additional factor to be considered. In measuring understanding, thinking skills, and other complex learning outcomes, knowledge of certain facts and simple computational skills also might be necessary prerequisites.

In constructing tests and assessments, then, we need to strive for items and tasks that measure achievement of the specific learning outcomes and not differences in ancillary abilities. Differences in reading ability, computational skill, communication skills, and the like should not influence the students' responses unless such outcomes are specifically being measured. The only functional difference between those students who perform well

on a task and those who perform poorly should be the possession of the knowledge, understanding, or other learning outcome being measured by the task. All other differences are extraneous to the purpose of the task, and their influence should be eliminated or controlled for valid results.

A special problem in preventing extraneous factors from distorting our test and assessment results is avoiding ambiguity. Objective test items are especially subject to misinterpretation when long, complex sentences are used; when the vocabulalY is unnecessarily difficult; and when words that lack precise meaning are used. Thus, from the viewpoint of both level of reading difficulty and preciseness of meaning, the antidote for ambiguity seems to be a careful choice of words and the use of brief, concise sentences. In some cases, ambiguity can be reduced by using pictures or other illustrative material in place of verbal descriptions. When this is done, the illustrative material must, of course, also be carefully checked to make sure it is clear and unambiguous.

Care should be taken to avoid any racial, ethnic, or gender bias in preparing the test items and performance assessment tasks. The vocabulaty and task situations should be acceptable to various racial and ethnic groups and to both males and females and should be free of stereotyping. For example, in presenting characters in a stoty problem, a reading passage, or other test situation, minorities should not be portrayed in stereotypical fashion. Similarly, task situations should not always place males in such traditional roles as athlete, business executive, and professional person and females in such traditional roles as homemaker, teacher, and nurse. A balanced use of different roles for minorities and males and females is necessaty if we are to avoid bias as a possible barrier to maximum performance. See Guidelines box 

##### **Avoiding Unintended Clues in Objective Test Items**

Test items should be constructed so that students obtain the correct answer only if they have attained the desired leaJning outcome. In the preceding principle, we were concerned with those factors that prevent students from responding cotTectly even though they have attained the desired learning outcome. Here we are concerned with those factors that

![](_page_171_Figure_6.jpeg)

enable students to respond correctly even though they lack the necessary achievement. These are the clues, some rather obvious and some very subtle , that inadvertently creep into test items during construction. They lead the poor aclliever to tile con'ect answer and thereby prevent tile items from functioning as intended. When test items are short-drcuited in tllis manner, they provide invalid evidence of achievement. Note how *an* provides a clue to the following item.

EXA.MPLE A porpoise is an

- A. plant B. reptile Â©animal
- D. bird

Such clues are not limited to selection-type items, as shown in the following supplytype item.

EXAMPLE A piece of land that is completely surrounded by water is known as an

The clue is much less obvious to the person constructing this test item than the clue in our first illustration. To the student taking the test, however, it is readily appareNT. The two most plausible answers are *island* and *peninsula.* Because *peninsula* begins with a consonant sound and does not follow tile article *an,* it is ruled out as a possibility. This does not imply, of course, that students need to know the rules for good grammatical structure in order to use clues; most clues are analyzed in tenns of partial knowledge and hunclles. *An peninsula* just does not sound right to the student, so the word *island* is used, and tile correct answer is obtained.

Leads to the con'ect answer may also be provided by simple verbal associations. Note how the word *wind* in the following item provides a clue to the answer.

| EXAMPLE | Which of the following instruments is used to determine the direction of the wind? |  |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
|         | A Anemometer                                                                       |  |
|         | B Barometer                                                                        |  |
|         | C Hygrometer                                                                       |  |
|         | @Windvane                                                                          |  |

Rather tlun lead the uninformed to the correct answer, such clues should lead the poor achiever away from the correct answer. In the following item, tile same clue makes

*wind vane* a plausible (but incorrect) answer for those students who have not learned the uses of the various weather instmments.

EXAMPLE Which one of the following instruments is used to determine the speed of the wind?

- A Anemometer B Barometer C Hygrometer
- @Windvane

Verbal clues need not be as obvious as these. In fact, the clues that appear in the final version of a test are usually rather subtle, as they are based on partial knowledge and verbal associations not readily apparent to the casual ObSeIyer. For example, at first glance the following item appears to be free from clues.

| EXAMPLE | Which one of the following is used to prevent polio?         |  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--|
|         | A Gamma globulin B Penicillin C Salk vaccine @Sulfa |  |

An examination of this item, however, will indicate that the word *vaccine* provides a clue to the answer. All the student needs to know to answer the item correctly is that a vaccine is used to prevent disease. Because most students have been vaccinated at o ne time or another, they probably possess this partial knowledge needed to make the clue apparent to them. Some students also may have developed a verbal association between *Salk* and *polio* and respond correctly on that basis. In either case, partial knowledge can lead to the correct answer and prevent the item from functioning as intended.

Another type of subtle clue is one based on the words used to qualify statements. For example, true-false statements that include qualifiers SUcil as *sometimes, usually, generally,* and the like are most often true, whereas statements containing absolutes such as *always, never, none,* and *only* are most often false. Such words have been called specific determiners. They are difficult to remove from tme-false items because true statements generally must be qualified, and false statements frequently must be stated in absolute tenns to make them clearly false.

Other common clues in selection-type items include (a) stating correct answers in textbook language or in greater detail than incorrect answers, (b) making correct answers longer than inCOlTect answers, and (c) placing the correct answers in some identifiable pattern (e.g., T, F, T, F). Some of these clues are more likely to be detected by low-achieving students who are desperately searching for some basis for answering. See the "Guidelines" box.

##### **General Suggestions for Writing Test Items and Assessment Tasks**

In preparing a set of test items or assessment tasks, the following general rules apply to all types of items or tasks. The specific lUles for writing each item or task type are described and illustrated in the following chapters.

1. Use your test and assessment specifications as a guide. The specifications describe the performance to be measured and the sample of learning outcomes to measure. Thus, they serve as an aid for selecting the types of items and tasks to prepare, for writing, and for determining how many items and tasks are needed for each subdomain of achievement.

2. Write more items and tasks than needed. Preparing more test items and assessment tasks than needed will permit the weaker items and tasks to be discarded during later review. It will also make it easier to match the final set of items and tasks to the specifications.

3. Write the items and tasks well in advance of the testing date. Setting the items and tasks aside for several days and then reviewing them with a fresh outlook will reveal any lack of clarity or ambiguity tllat was overlooked during their preparation. It is frequently surprising how many defects slipped through during the original writing.

4. Write eadl test item and assessment task so that the task to be performed is clearly defined and it calls forth the perfonnance described in the intended learning outcome. Clarity is obtained by carefully formulating the question and instlUctions, using simple and direct language, using conect punctuation and grammar, and avoiding unnecessary wording. During both writing and review, compare the task students are asked to perform to the iearning outcome the task is designed to measure to make sure the two match.

5. Write each item or task at an appropliate reading level. Keep the reading difficulty and vocabulary level as simple as possible to prevent these factors from distolting the results. Students' responses should be determined by the perfomlance being measured, not by some factor tlle item or task was not designed to measure.

6. Write eadl item or task so that it does not provide help in responding to other items or tasks. Unless care is taken during writing, one item may provide infonnation that is

useful in answering another item. For example, a name, date, or fact inadvertently included in the stem of a multiple-choice item may be called for in a short-answer item in another part of the test.

7. Write each item so that the answer is one that would be agreed on by experts or, in the case of assessment tasks, the responses judged excellent would be agreed on by experts. This rule is easy to satisfy when measuring factual knowledge but more difficult when measuring complex outcomes calling for the extended essays or other types of performance.

8. Whenever a test item or assessment task is revised, recheck its relevance. When reviewing items or tasks for appropriateness, clarity, difficulty, and freedom from clues and bias, some revision is often needed. After revising an item or task, check to be sure that it still provides a relevant measure of the intended learning outcome. Even slight changes can sometimes modify the function of an item or a task.

##### Focusing on Improving Learning and Instruction

The ultimate purpose of testing and assessment is to improve student learning. As you construct classroom tests and assessments, keep in mind the extent to which it is likely to contribute, directly or indirectly, toward this end. Well-constructed classroom tests and assessments should increase both the quantity and the quality of student learning.

1. Tests and assessments can have a desirable influence on student learning if teachers pay attention to the breadth and depth of content and learning outcomes measured. When we select a representative sample of content from all the areas covered in our instruction, we are emphasizing to the students that they must devote attention to all areas. They cannot neglect some aspects of the course and do well on the tests. By giving more weight to high-priority objectives that are emphasized in instruction, we also encourage at the same time a concentration of effort on those objectives thought to be most important. Similarly, when our tests measure a variety of types of learning outcomes, the students soon learn that a mass of memorized factual information is not sufficient. They must also learn to interpret and apply facts, develop deep conceptual understandings, draw conclusions, recognize assumptions, identify cause-and-effect relations, generate hypotheses, solve meaningful problems, and the like. This discourages the students from depending solely on memorization as a basis for learning and encourages them to develop the use of more complex mental processes.

2. Constructing tests and assessments that measure a variety of learning outcomes should also lead to improved teaching procedures and, thus, indirectly to improved student learning. As we translate the various learning outcomes into test items and assessment tasks, we clarify our notion of understandings, thinking skills, and other complex learning outcomes. This clarification enables us to plan the learning experiences of students more effectively and increases the degree to which we emphasize understandings, thinking skills, and other complex learning outcomes in our teaching. A well-constructed test or assessment frequently leads to a review of teaching procedures and to the abandonment of those that encourage rote learning.

3. Tests and assessments will contlibute to improved teacher-student relations (with a beneficial effect on student learning) if students view tbe tests and assessments as fair and useful measures of their achievement. We can make fairness apparent by including a representative sample of the learning outcomes that have been emphasized during instruction by writing clear directions, by making certain that the intent of each item or task is clear and that each item is free of any type of bias that would prevent a knowledgeable person from performing well, and by providing adequate time limits. Student recognition of usefulness, however, depends as much on what we do with the results of the test or assessment as on the characteristics of the instmment itself. We make the usefulness apparent by using the results as a basis for gUiding and improving learning.

#### SUMMARY

Planning the classroom tests and assessments involves (a) determining the purpose of measurement, (b) developing a set of specifications, (c) selecting appropriate types of test items and assessment tasks, and (d) preparing a set of relevant items and tasks.

Classroom tests and assessments can be used for a variety of instmctional purposes, best described in terms of their location in the instructional sequence. There are (a) pretests at the beginning of a course or unit to determine learning readiness, to aid in instructional planning, and to make advanced placements; (b) tests and assessments during instruction to improve and direct student learning and to identify and remedy learning errors; and (c) end-of-instruction tests and assessments llsed at the end of a course or ~~\_: .........

J:.aUI UI llle~e lype~ UI classroom testing and assessment places different demands on sampling of items and tasks and the type of interpretation used (Le. , criterion referenced or norm referenced).

A sample of student performance is more likely to be representative if a set of specifications is used in planning the test or assessment. Specifications define and delimit the achievement domain to be measured and describe the sample of test items and assessment tasks to be prepared. One form of specifications is a two-way c11alt called a table of specifications. Building the table involves (a) obtaining the list of instructional objectives, (b) outlining the course content, and (c) preparing the two-way malt that relates the instructional objectives to the course content and specifies the nature of the desired sample of items and tasks. Although a table of specifications is especially useful in preparing summative tests and assessments (because of the broad coverage), it is also useful in preparing some formative tests and assessments. In other cases, however, a test or assessment plan might be limited to a brief list of specific and precisely stated learning outcomes, or it might contain a comprehensive and detailed set of spedfications with illustrative sample items or tasks.

The major categories of objective tests or performance assessments may be further subdivided into the following basic types of test items and assessment tasks.

 Objective Test

- A. Supply type
	- 1. Short answer
	- 2. Completion
- B. Selection type
	- 1. True-false or alternative response
	- 2. Matching
	- 3. Multiple d10ice

 Performance Assessment

- A. Extended response
- B. Restricted response

Objective tests present students with a highly structured task that limits their response to supplying a word, brief phrase, number, or symbol or to selecting the answer from among a given number of alternatives. Performance assessments permit students to respond by selecting, organizing, and presenting ideas or performing in a way they consider appropriate. Both objective tests and performance assessments serve useful purposes in measuring student achievement. The type to use in a particular situation is best determined by the learning outcomes to be measured and by the unique advantages and lin1ltations of each approach. A good practice is to include both objective test items and performance assessment tasks in a comprehensive measurement of student achievement.

The preparation of a set of relevant test items and assessment tasks involves (a) matching the items and tasks to the learning outcomes as directly as possible, (b) obtaining a representative sample of all intended outcomes, (c) eliminating in-elevant barriers to the answer, (d) preventing unintended dues to the response, and (e) focusing on improving learning and instmction. The rules for constructing each type of objective test item and performance assessment task are described in tl1e chapters that follow.

### CHAPTER 7: CONSTRUCTING OBJECTIVE TEST ITEMS: SIMPLE FORMS

I ach type of test item has its own unique characteristics, uses, advantages, limitations, and rules for construction. In this chapter, these characteristics are considered for objective test forms that typically measure relatively simple learning outcomes: (a) the short-answer item, (b) the true-false item, and (c) the matching exercise.

The preliminary test planning described in Chapter 6 provides a sound basis for developing classroom tests that can be used for a variety of instructional purposes. The test specifications clarify the sample of achievement to be measured, and the various considerations in test planning form a general framework within which to proceed. The next step is the actual construction of test items. This step is crucial because the validity of a classroom test is ultimately determined by the extent to which the performance to be measured is actually called forth by the test items. Selecting item types that are inappropriate for the learning outcomes to be measured, constructing items with technical defects, or unwittingly including irrelevant clues in the items can undermine all the careful planning that has gone on before.

The construction of good test items is an art. The skills it requires, however, are the same as those found in effective teaching. Needed are a thorough grasp of subject matter, a clear conception of the desired learning outcomes, a psychological understanding of students, sound judgment, persistence, and a touch of creativity. The only additional requisite for constructing good test items is the skillful application of an array of simple but important rules and suggestions. These techniques of test construction are the topic of this and the next two chapters. The rules for constructing test items, described in these chapters, are applicable to all types of classroom tests using supply-type or selection-type items. Guidelines for constructing assessments using essay questions or other types of performance assessments are provided in Chapters 10 and 11.

CourseSmart

In this chapter, we limit our discussion to the simpler forms of objective test items: (a) short-answer items, (b) true-false or alternative-response items, and (c) matcl1ing exercises. These item types are treated together, as their use in classroom testing is restricted largely to the measurement of simple learning outcomes in the knowledge area. The discussion of each item type is followed by a checklist for reviewing the items.

#### **SHORT-ANSWER ITEMS**

The short-answer item and the completion item both are supply-type test items that can be answered by a word, phrase, number, or symbol. They are essentially the same, differing only in the method of presenting the problem. The shol1-answer item uses a direct question, whereas the completion item consists of an incomplete statement.

##### EXAMPLES Short Answer

What is the name of the man who invented the steamboat? (Robert Fulton)

 Completion

The name of the man who invented the steamboat is \_\_\_\_\_ ,. (Robert Fulton)

Also included in this category are problems in arithmetic, mathematics, science, and other areas whose solution must be supplied by the student.

##### Uses of Short-Answer Items

The short-answer test item is suitable for measuring a wide variety of relatively simple learning outcomes. The following outcomes and test items illustrate some of its common uses.

EXAMPLES Knowledge of Terminology

Lines on a weather map that join points of the same barometric pressure are called . (isobars)

 KnOWledge of Specific Facts

A member of the United States Senate is elected to a term of \_\_\_\_\_ years. (2.)

 Knowledge of Principles

If the temperature of a gas is held constant while the pressure applied to it is increased, what will happen to its volume? (It will decrease)

 Knowledge of Method or Procedure

What device is used to detect whether an electric charge is positive or negative? (electroscope)

 Simple Interpretations of Data

How many syllables are there in the word Argentina? ~ In the number 612, what value does the 6 represent? (.2QQ) In the triangle below, what is the number of degrees in each angle? (Â§Q)

![](_page_181_Figure_5.jpeg)

If an airplane flying northwest made a 180-degree turn, what direction would it be heading? (southeast)

More complex interpretations can be made when the short-answer item is used to measure the ability to interpret diagrams, charts, graphs, and pictorial data.

Even more notable exceptions to the general rule that short-answer items are limited to measuring simple learning outcomes are found in the areas of mathematics and saence, where the solutions to problems can be indicated by numbers or symbols. The following examples illustrate this use.

 EXAMPLF5 Ability to Solve Numerical Problems

Milk sells for \$.96 a quart and \$3.68 a gallon. How many cents would you save on each quart of milk if you bought it by the gallon? @

Skill in Manipulating Mathematical Symbols

| Ability to Complete and Balance Chemical Equations |                 |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Mg + (2) HCI ~ ?                                   | (MgClz + Hg)    |
| (2) AI + (6) HCI ~ ?                               | (2 AICI3 + 3H2) |

For outcomes similar to those in these last examples, the short-answer item is clearly superior to items that require the student to select an answer. The perfonnance described in the learning outcomes is identical with the performance called forth by the test items. To obtain correct answers, students must actually solve problems, manipulate mathematical symbols, and complete and balance equations.

Attempts are sometimes made to measure such problem-solving activities with selection-type test items, commonly resulting in test items that do not function as intended or that measure quite different learning outcomes. In the following multiplechoice items, for example, note how the division problem can be solved by working it backward (multiplying 2 x 43, or merely 2 x 3) and how in the second problem the value of x can be determined by substituting eadl of the alternative answers in the equation on a trial-and-error basis. Such problems obviously do not demand the problem-solving behavior we are attempting to measure.

| Â©       | 32                             |
| o       | 48                             |
|         |                                |

Similar difficulties are encountered when we substitute selection items measuring the ability to "recognize balanced chemical equations" for shott-answer items measuring the ability to "complete and balance chemical equations." The selection task is a simple one reqUiring little more than a knowledge of mathematics, but the short-answer task requires extensive knowledge of chemical reactions and their resulting products.

For large-scale testing programs, it is possible to maintain some of the advantages of the supply-type item for mathematics problems that result in numerical answers while still retaining the efficiencies of machine scoring. The grid-in item, for example, was introduced on the Scholastic Assessment Test in the spring of 1994. This item type requires examinees to solve problems and enter their numerical responses in a grid (see example).

EXAMPLE

Five students get scores of 9, 7, 7,5, and 4 on an eight-item quiz. What is the average score for these five students?

|     | 6   |       | 4   |

Grid-in problems requiring complex problem solving can be constructed, but the approach is likely to be useful only when a test is administered to a large number of students. For classroom use, short-answer problems and extended free-response assessment tasks of the type discussed in Chapters 10 and 11 are likely to provide more information about how students approach such problems and the nature of the difficulties they encounter.

In summary, if the short-answer test item is most effective for measuring a specific learning outcome, then it should be used. We should not discard it for selection-type items unless we are fairly certain that the same learning outcomes will be measured. For many of the simpier iearning outcomes, such as knowiedge of factuai information, changing to some form of selection item will not decrease the validity of the measurement and will result in increased objectivity and ease of scoring. For some of the more complex learning outcomes, such as those in mathematics and science, however, discarding the shortanswer test item may mean a change in the learning outcomes being measured and, hence, reduce the validity for the intended outcomes. In deciding whether to use shortanswer items or some other item type our best guide is to follow this prindple: Each learning outcome should be measured as directly as pOSSible, and the test-item type most appropriate for the purpose should be used.

##### **Advantages and limitations of Short-Answer Items**

The short-answer test item is one of the easiest to construct, partly because of the relatively simple learning outcomes it usually measures. Except for the problem-solving outcomes measured in mathematics and science, the short-answer item is used almost exclusively to measure tile recall of memorized information.

A more important advantage of the short-answer item is that the students must supply the answer. This reduces the pOSSibility that the students will obtain tile correct answer by guessing. They must eitller recall the information requested or make the necessary computations to solve the problem presented to tllem. Partial knowledge, which might enable them to choose the correct answer on a selection item, is insufficient for answering a shortanswer test item correctly.

Two major limitations restrict the use of the short-answer test item. One------unsuitability for measuring complex learning outcomes-has already been mentioned. The other is the difficulty of scoring. Unless the question is carefully phrased, many answers of varying degrees of correctness must be considered for total or partial aÂ·edit. For example, a question SUcll as "Where was George Washington born?" could be answered by the name of the dty, county, state, region, county, or continent. Although the teacher may have had the name of the state in mind when writing the question, the other answers cannot be dismissed as incorrect. Even when this problem is avoided, however, the scoring may be contaminated by the student's spelling ability. If full or partial credit is taken off for misspelled words, the students' test scores will reflect varying degrees of knowledge and spelling skill. If spelling is not counted in the scoring, the teacller must still decide whether lniSspelled words actually represent the COlTect answer. We all are familiar with misspellings so bad that it is difficult to determine what the student had in mind. The complications make scoring more time consuming and less objective than that obtained with selectiontype items.

These limitations are less troublesome when the answer is to be expressed in numbers or symbols, as in physical sdence or mathematics. Here, more complex learning outcomes can be measured, spelling is not a problem, and it is usually easier to write test items for which there is only one correct response.

##### **Suggestions for Constructing Short-Answer Items**

The short-answer item is subject to a variety of defects, even though it is considered one of the easier to construct. The following suggestions will help you avoid possible pitfalls and provide greater assurance that the items will function as intended.

1. Word the item so that the required answer is both brief and specific. As indicated earlier, the answer to an item should be a word, phrase, number, or symbol. This can be easily conveyed to the students through the directions at the beginning of the test and by proper phrasing of the question. More difficult is stating the question so that only one answer is correct.

EXAMPLES *Poor:* An animal that eats the flesh of other animals is (carnivorous) . Better: An animal that eats the flesh of other animals is classified as (carnivorous).

> The first version of this item is so indefinite that it could be completed with answers such as *the wolf, the lion,* or even *hungry.* Asking the students to classify this type of animal, as called for in the improved version, better structures the problem and defines the type of response reqUired.

> 2. Do not take statements directly from textbooks to use as a basis for short-answer items. When taken out of context, textbook statements are frequently too general and ambiguous to serve as good short-answer items. Note the vagueness of the first version of the following test item, which was taken verbatim from a chemistry textbook.

 EXAMPLES *Poor:* Chlorine is a (halogen). Better: Chlorine belongs to a group of elements that combine with metals to form salts. It is therefore called a (halogen).

Students are most likely to respond to the first version of this test item with the word *gas* because that is the natural state of chlOrine, and there is nothing in the statement to imply that the word *halogen* is wanted. The only students who are apt to supply the intended answer are those who memorized the textbook statements. The revised version measures factual knowledge that is not dependent on the phraseology of the textbook. Such items tend to discourage the students from developing little-understood verbal associations based on textbook language and encourage them to achieve the learning outcomes being measured. When items are not taken verbatim from another source, it also forces the item writer to carefully consider the importance of the word or phrase being omitted as well as the other words or phrases in the sentence that mlght provide a clue to the answer.

3. A direct question is generally more desirable than an incomplete statement. There are two advantages to the direct-question form. First, it is more nanlral to the students, as this is the usual method of phrasing questions in daily classroom discussions. This is especially important to elementary students when first exposed to shOit-answer tests. Second, the direct question is usually better structured and free of much of the ambiguity that creeps into items based on incomplete statements. Just the phrasing of a question reqUires us to decide what it is we want to know.

EXAMPLES 
*Poor* :John Glenn made his first orbital flight around the earth in . (1962) __ 
*Better*: When did John Glenn make his first orbital flight around the earth? _ . (1962) |
*Best*:  In what year did John Glenn make his first orbital flight around the earth? (1962)                                                                                      |

The first version of the item could, of course, be completed with *a space capsuLe, Friendship Seven, space,* and simllar answers. Putting it in question fonn forces us to indicate whether it is the time, place, or method we are interested in knowing. The last version is a refinement that makes the question even more specific and that naturally evolves from a consideration of the whet/. aspect of the previous question.

wanted. For computational problems, it is usually preferable to indicate the units in which the answer is to be expressed. This will clarify the problem and will simplify the scoring.

EXAMPLES
*Poor*: If oranges weigh 52/3 oz. each, how much will a dozen oranges weigh? (4 lb. 4 oz.)
*Better*:  If oranges weigh 5213 oz. each, how much will a dozen oranges weigh? oz. ~) lb. @ oz. | __ lb. |

Unless the type of unit is specified, as in the revised version, con'ect answers will indude 68 *oz.,* 4 V4 lb., 4.25 lb., and 4 lb. 4 *oz.* This adds unnece5Sa1)' confusion to the scoring.

When the problems do not come out even, it is also usually helpful to indicate the degree of precision expected in the answers. For example, specifying that the answers should be "carried out to two decimal places" or "rounded off to the nearest tenth of a percent" makes dear to the students how far to carry their calculations. This will ensure that they reach the degree of precision desired and also prevent them from wasting valuable testing time attempting to achieve a degree of precision not expected.

There are some instances, especially in science, when knowing the proper unit in which the answer is to be expressed and knowing the degree of precision to be expected are important aspects of the learning outcome to be measured. In SUd1 cases, the previous suggestions must, of course, be modified.

5. Blanks for answers should be equal in length and in a column to the right of the question. If blanks for answers are kept equal in length, the length of the blank space does not supply a due to the answer. In the poor version of the following items, the lengths of the blanks restrict the possible answers the students need consider. For the first item they need a long word and for the second item a short one.

| EXAMPLES | Poor: What is the name of the part of speech that connects words, clauses, and  sentences? __ (conjunction)
|          |       What is the name of the part of speech that declares, asserts, or predicts something? __ (Verb)    
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|          | Better: What is the name of the part of speech that connects words, clauses, and sentences?  ___ (conjunction) 
|          | What is the name of the part of speech that declares, asserts, or predicts something? __ (verb)                  

Placing the blanks in a column to the right of the question makes scoring quicker and more accurate. Avoid giving unintentional clues that the answer is a short or long word by making the blanks the same size and large enough for the longest response.

6. When completion items are used, do not indude too many blanks. If a statement is too mutilated by blanks, the meaning will be lost, and the student will have to guess what the tead1er had in mind. Although some mutilated statements seem to measure complex reasoning abilities, such responses are more appropriate as measures of intelligence than achievement.

EXAMPLES Poor: (Warm-blooded) animals that are born (alive) and (suckle) their young are called (mammals). *Better:* Warm-blooded animals that are bom alive and suckle their young are called (mammals).

| 12. Have the items been set aside for a time before reviewing them?                |           |

In the revised version, the blank is at the end of the statement so that the students are presented with a clearly defined problem before they come to the blank. See the "Checklist" box for a review of the guidelines for constructing short-answer tests.

#### **TRUE-FALSE OR ALTERNATIVE-RESPONSE ITEMS**

The alternative-response test item consists of a declarative statement that the student is asked to mark true or false , right or wrong, conÂ·ect or incorrect, yes or no, fact or opinion, agree or disagree, or the like. In each case, there are only two possible answers. Because the true-false option is the most conunon, this item type is most frequently referred to as the true-false test item. Some of the variations, however, deviate considerably from the simple true-false pattern and have their own characteristics. For this reason, some prefer the more generai category aitemative-response item. Here we rdain the more commoniy used true-false designation.

##### Uses of True-False **Items**

Probably the most common use of the true-false item is in measuring the ability to identify the conÂ·ectness of statements of fact, definitions of tenns, statements of principles, and the like. For measuring SUcll relatively simple learning outcomes, a single declarative statement is used with anyone of several methods of responding.

EXAMPLES Directions: Read each of the following statements. If the statement is true, cirde the T. If the statement is false, cirde the F.

| *T* | F   | 1. The green coloring material in a plant leaf is called chlorophyll. |
|---- |---  |-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| T   | *F* | 2. The corolla of a flower indudes petals and sepals.                 |
| *T* | F   | 3. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves make a plant's food. |

*Directions:* Read each of the following questions. If the answer is yes, circle the Y. If the answer is no, circle the N.

| *Y* | N   | 1. Is 50% of 38 more than 18?                             |
|-----|---  |-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Y   | *N* | 2. Is 50% of 4/10 equal to 2/5?                           |
| Y   | *N* | 3. If 60% of a number is 9, is the number smaller than 9? |
| *Y* | N   | 4. Is 25% of 44 less than 12?                             |

One of the useful functions of the true-false item is in measuring the student's ability to distinguish fa ct from opinion. The following examples illustrate this use.

| EXAMPLES Direcuons: Read each of the following statements. If the statement is a fact, circle the F. If the statement is an opinion, circle the O.      |  

|  *F*       O       | 1. The Constitution of the United States is the highest law of our country.                        |  |  |  |
|   F       *O*      | 2, The First Amendment to the constitution is the most important amendment  |
|  *F*       O       | 3. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protects people from testifying against themselves. | 
|   F       *O*      | 4. Other countries should adopt a constitution like that of the United States.             |


Direcuons: Read each of the following statements. If the statement is true, circle the T. If the statement is false, circle the F. If the statement is an opinion, circle the O | 
|  *T*    F     O       | 1. The earth is a planet.                        |  |  |  |
|   T    *F*    O       | 2. The earth revolves around the moon
|   T     F    *O*      | 3. There are intelligent life forms on planets orbiting some distant stars.             |

These items measure a learning outcome important to all subject-matter areas: If people are to think critically about a topic, they must first be able to distinguish fact from opinion.

All too frequently, true-false tests include numerous opinion statements to which the student is asked to respond true or false . This is extremely frustrating because there is no objective basis for determining whether a statement of opinion is true or false. The student must usually guess what opinion the teacher holds and mark the answers accordingly. This, of course, is undesirable from all standpoints- testing, teaching, and learning. It is much better to have the student identify statements of opinion as such. An alternative

procedure is to attribute the opinion to some source, making it possible to mark the statements true or false and measuring knowledge concerning the beliefs held by an individual or the values supported by an organization or institution.

| EXAMPLES | Directions: Read each of the following statements. If the statement is true, circle the T. If the statement is false, circle the F. |       

|   T    *F*   | 1. Franklin D. Roosevelt believed that labor unions interfered with the U.S. free-enterprise system
|   T    *F*   | 2. The National Rifle Association favors strict gun control laws.
|  *T*    F    | 3. The National Education Association opposes the use of public funds for vouchers for students to attend private schools             |

Items like these can become measures of understanding if the opinion statements attributed to an individual or group are new to the student. The task then becomes one of interpreting the beliefs held by the individual or group and applying them to the new situation.

Another aspect of understanding that can be measured by the true-false item is the ability to recognize cause-and-effect relationships. This type of item usually contains two true propositions in one statement, and the student is to judge whether the relationship between them is true or false.

EXAMPLES *Directions:* In each of the following statements, both parts of the statement are true. You are to decide whether the second part explains why the first part is true. If it does, circle Yes. If it does not, cirde No. Yes Yes 1. Leaves are essential *because* they shade the tree trunk. 2. Whales are mammals *because* they are large.

No 3. Some plants do not need sunlight *because* they get their food from other plants.

The true--false item also can be used to measure some simple aspects of logic, as illustrated by the following items that were developed for use in a science test.

EXAMPLES *Directions:* Read each of the following statements. If the statement is true, circle the T; if it is false, circle the F. Also, if the converse of the statement is true, cirde the CT; if the converse is false, circle the CF. Be sure to give two answers for each statement.

A common criticism of the true-false item is that a student may be able to recognize a false statement as incorrect but still not know what is correct. For example, when students answer the following item as false, it does not indicate whether they know what negatively charged particles of electricity are called; all the answer tells us is that they know they are not called neutrons.

| EXAMPLE | T | *F* | Negatively charged particles of electricity are called neutrons. |  |
|---------|---|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------|--|

This is a rather crude measure of knowledge because there is an infinite number of things that negatively charged particles of electricity are *not* called. To overcome such difficulties, some teachers prefer to have the students change all false statements to true. When this is reqUired, the palt of the statement it is permissible to change should be indicated.

 EXAMPLES Directions: Read each of the following statements. If a statement is true, circle the T. If a statement is false, circle the F and change the underlined word to make the statement true. Place the new word in the blank space after the F.

| T  | *F* | (electrons) | 1. Partides of negatively charged electricity are called neutrons.                  |
|----|-----|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|*T* |  F  |             | 2. Mechanical energy is turned into electrical energy by means of the generator. |
| T  | *F* |             | 3. An electric condenser is used to generate electricity.                           |

Unless the key words to be cl1anged are indicated, students are liable to rewrite the entire statement. In addition to the increase in scoring difficulty, this frequently leads to true statements that deviate conSiderably from the original intent of tl1e item. A clever student may even cl1ange false statements to true by simply adding *not* in the appropriate place.

##### Advantages and Limitations of True- False Items

A major advantage of true-false items is that they are efficient. Students can typically respond to roughly three true-false items in me time it takes to respond to two multiple-cllOice items (Ebel & Frisbie, 1991).

Proponents of true-false items such as Ebel and Frisbie (1991) argue that verbal knowledge is central to educational achievement and that "all verbal knowledge can be expressed in propositions" which can be judged to be true or false Cp. 135). They make a strong case that true-false items have utility for measuring a broad range of verbal knowledge.

One advantage cited frequently for true-false items is, unfortunately, more illusory than real: ease of construction. This has probably resulted from the common practice of taking statements from textbooks, changing half of them to false statements, and submitting the product to students as a true-false test. Sucl1 test items are often so obvious that everyone gets them correct or so ambiguous that even the better students are confused by them. In short, it is easy to construct *poor* true-false items. To construct unambiguous true-false items that measure Significant learning outcomes, however, requires much skill.

A second advantage attributed to the true-false item is that a wide sampling of course material can be obtained. Certainly a student can respond to many test items in a short time, which makes it possible to cover a wide range of content, but some types of subjea matter do not lend themselves to tme-false types of items. Tme-false statements require course material that can be phrased so that the statements are tme or false without qualification or exception. There are areas in which such absolutely true or false statements cannot be made. In some fields, such as the social sdences, practically all significant statements require some qualification. In some subject areas, only relatively trivial statements can be reduced to absolute terms.

One of the most serious limitations of the true- false item is in the types of learning outcomes that can be measured . True- false items are not especially useful beyond the knowledge area. The exceptions to this seem to be distinguishing between fact and opinion and identifying cause-and-effect relationships. These two outcomes are probably the most important measured by this type of item. Many of the learning outcomes measured by the true-false item can be measured more effectively by other forms of selection items, especially the multiple-choice form.

Another factor that limits the usefulness of the true-false item is its susceptibility to guessing. With only two alternatives, a student has a 50/ 50 chance of selecting the conect answer on the basis of chance alone, and because of the difficulty of constmcting items that do not contain clues to the answer, the student's chances of guessing correctly are usually much greater than 50%. l11is disadvantage is offset, however, by the relatively large number of items that can be answered in a given period of time. Nevertheless, with a typical 100-item true-false test, it is not unusual to have the lowest score above 80. An indetenninate amount of knowledge is reflected in such a score: Many of the correct answers can be accounted by chance or the presence of clues. A scoring formula uilizing a correction for guessing is frequently suggested as a solution for this problem. This formula compensates only chance guesses, however, and does not include those guided by dues. In addition, sucl1 a scoring formula favors individuals willing to take a chance. Even when warned that there will be a penalty for guessing, these individuals will continue to guess, using any clues available, and will do better than chance. Cautious students, on the other hand, will mark only those answers they are certain are correct and will omit many items they could have marked correctly using dues and partial infonnation. Thus, the scores tend to reflect personality differences as well as knowledge of the subject.

The great likelihood of successful guessing on the true-false item has two implications that should be taken into account: (a) The reliability of each item is low, making it necessary to include many items in order to obtain a reliable measure of achievement; and (b) the diagnostic value of such a test is practically nil because analyzing a student's response to each item is meaningless.

One last caution that needs to be considered in the design of tests with true-false items is student response sets. As noted earlier, a response set is a consistent tendency to follow a certain pattern in responding to test items. In taking a tme-false test, for example, some students will consistently mark "tme" those items they do not know, and others will consistently mark them "false. " Thus, if tl1ere is not a balance between tme and false items, a given test will favor one response set over anotl1er and introduce an element into the test score that is inelevant to tl1e purpose of the test.

True-false items are most useful in situations in which there are only two possible alternatives (e.g., right, left; more, less; who, whom) and spedaluses such as distinguishing fact from opinion, cause from effect, superstition from scientific belief, relevant from irrelevant information, valid from invalid conclusions, and the like.

##### Suggestions for Constructing True- False Items

The main task in constructing true-false items is formulating statements free from ambiguity and irrelevant clues. This is extremely difficult, and the only guidance that can be given is a list of things to *avoid* when phrasing the statements.

1. Avoid broad general statements if they are to be judged true or false. Most broad generalizations are false unless qualified, and the use of qualifiers provides clues to the answer.

| EXAMPLF5 |  |  |
|----------|--|--|
|          |  |  |

| Poor: | T   | *F* | The president of the United States is elected to that office.
|-------|-----|---  |
| Poor: | *T* | F   | The president of the United States is usually elected to that office.

In this example, the first version is generally true but must be marked false because there are exceptions, such as when the vice president takes office in event of the president's death. In the second version, the qualifier *usually* makes the statement true but provides a definite due. Words such as *usuall)" gellerally, often,* and *sometimes* are more likely to appear in true statements, and absolute terms such as *aluJaJ's, never, all, tlone,* and *only* are more apt to appear in false statements. Although the influence of SUdl clues sometimes can be offset by balancing their use in true-false statements, the Simplest solution seems to be to avoid the lise of broad generalizations that are obviously false or must be qualified by specific detemliners.

2. Avoid trivial statements. In an attempt to obtain statements that are uneqUivocally true or false, we sometimes inadvertently tum to specific statements of fact that fit this criterion beautifully but have little significance from a learning standpOint.

| EXAMPLES

| Poor: | *T* | F   | Harry S. Truman was the thirty-third president of the United States
| Poor: | T   | *F* |The United States declared war on Japan on December 7, 1941.
|-------|-----|---  |


The first item calls for a relatively unimportant fact concerning Truman's tenure as president, and the second item expects the student to remember that the United States did not declare war until December 8. SUcll items cause students to direct their attention toward memorizing minutiae at the expense of more general knowledge and understanding.

3. Avoid tlle use of negative statements, especially double negatives. Students tend to overlook negative words such as 110 or 11Ot, and double negatives contribute to the statement's ambiguity. Note the ambiguity in tllis relatively simple statement, which uses two negatives.

EXAMPLF5

![](_page_192_Picture_14.jpeg)

None of the steps in the experiment was unnecessary. All of the steps in the experiment were necessary.

When a negative word must be used, it should be underlined or put in italics so that students do not overlook it.

4. Avoid long, complex sentences. As noted earlier, a test item should indicate whether a student has achieved the knowledge or understanding being measured. Long, complex sentences tend also to measure the extraneous factor of reading comprehension and therefore should be avoided in tests designed to measure achievement.

| EXAMPLES 
| Poor:   | *T* | F   |Despite the theoretical and experimental difficulties of determining the exact pH value of a solution, it is possible to determine whether a solution is acid by the red color formed on litmus paper when it is inserted into the solution.
| Better: | *T* | F   | Litmus paper tums red in an acid solution.


As in the preceding example, it frequently is possible to shorten and simplify a statement by elinlinating nonfunctional material and restating the main idea. If this is not possible, it may be necessaty to change to another item form in order to avoid a complex sentence structure.

S. Avoid induding two ideas in one statement, unless cause-and-effect relationships are being measured. Some difficulties arising from the inclusion of two ideas in one statement are apparent in the following example, which is one of many similar items a teacher actuaiiy used in a biology examination. In each instance, the students were asked to judge merely whether the statement was true or false.

EXAMPLE Poor: T *F* A worm cannot see because it has simple eyes.

> Tllis item is keyed false because a worm does not have simple eyes. However, when this teacher asked a student why he marked it false, the student said, "Worms *can* see. " This demonstrates that students can get items correct with erroneous information. Tllis is so because the first proposition can be true or false, the second proposition can be true or false , and the relationship between them can be true or false. Thus, when students mark the item false , there is no way of determining to which of the three elements they are responding. The best soiution to this dilenuna seems to be to use oniy true propositions and to ask the students to judge the truth or falsity of the relationships between them. Such items also might, of course, be divided into two simple statements, each containing a single idea.

> 6. If opinion is used, attribute it to some source, unless the ability to identify opinion is being specifically measured. Statements of opinion cannot be marked true or false, and it is unfair to expect students to guess how the teacher will score sllch items or to respond to opinion statements as statements of fact. Knowing whether some significant individual or group supports or refutes a certain opinion, however, can be important from a learning standpoint.

| EXAMPLF.5 | Poor:   | T | *F* | Adequate medical care can be best provided through socialized medicine.                                           |
|-----------|---------|---|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|           | Better: | T | *F* | The American Medical Association favors socialized medicine as the best means of providing adequate medical care. |

The first version cannot be answered true or false. It may serve a useful purpose in an attitude test, but there is no factual basis on which to decide the tmth or falsity of the statement. The second version is dearly false.

7. True statements and false statements should be approximately equal in length. TI1ere is a natural tendency for tme statements to be longer because such statements must be precisely phrased in order to be absolutely true. This can be overcome by lengthening the false statements through the use of qualifying phrases similar to those found in tme statements. Thus, the length of the statement will be eliminated as a possible clue to the correct answer.

8. The number of true statements and false statements should be approximately equal. Constl'llcting a test with an approximately equal number of tme statements and false statements will prevent response sets from unduly inflating or deflating the students' scores. You will recall that some students consistently mark statements "true" when in doubt about an answer, whereas others consistently mark them "false. " Neither response set should be favored by overloading the test with items of one type.

In honoring this suggestion, the words *approximately equal* should be given speciai attention. If a teacher consistentiy uses exactiy the same number, this wiii provide a clue to the student who is unable to answer some of the test items. The best procedure seems to be to vary the percentage of true sta tements somewhere between 40% and 60%. Under no circumstances should the statements be all true or all false. Students who detect this as a possibility can obtain perfect scores on the basis of one guess.

See the "Checklist" box for questions to use in reviewing true-false items.

#### **MATCHING EXERCISES**

In its traditional form, the matching exercise consists of two parallel columns with each word, number, or symbol in one column being matched to a word, sentence, or phrase in the other column. The items in the column for which a match is sought are called premises, and the items in the column from which the selection is made are called responses. The basis for matching premises to responses is sometimes self-evident but more often must be explained in the directions. In any event, the student's task is to identify the pairs of items that are to be associated on the basis indicated. For example , the student may be asked to identify impol1ant historical events, as in the following illustration.

This matching exercise illustrates an imperfect match; that is, there are more names in column B than are needed to match each event in column A. The directions also indicate that an item may be used once, more than once, or not at all. Both of these procedures prevent students from matching the final pair of items on the basis of elimination.

Two other factors are notable in our example. First, the items in the list of premises in Column A are homogeneous, as they all are concerned with important space events. Such homogeneity is necessary if a matching exercise is to function properly. Second, for each premise in Column A, there are several plausible responses in Column B. Thus, the incorrect responses serve as attractive choices for those students who are in doubt about the correct answers. Both factors tend to minimize the opportunity for successful guessing.

##### **Uses of Matching Exercises**

The typical matching exercise is limited to measuring factual information based on simple associations. Whenever learning outcomes emphasize the ability to identify the relationship between two things and a sufficient number of homogeneous premises and responses can be obtained, a matching exercise seems most appropriate. **It** is a compact and efficient method of measuring such simple knowledge outcomes. Examples of relationships considered important by teachers, in a variety of fields, include the following:

|  Persons                | Achievements        |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
|  Dates                  | Historical Events   |
|  Terms                  | . Definitions       |
|  Rules                  | Examples            |
|  Symbols                | Concepts            |
|  Authors                | Titles of Books     |
|  Foreign Words          | English Equivalents |
|  Machines               | Uses                |
|  Plants or Animals      | Classification      |
|  Principles             | illustrations       |
|  Objects                | Names of Objects    |
|  Parts                  | Functions           |

The matching exercise has also been used. with pictorial materials in relating pictures and words or to identify positions on maps, charts, and diagrams. Regardless of the fom1 of presentation, the student's task is essentially to relate two things that have some logical basis for association. This restricts the use of the matching exercise to a relatively small area of student achievement.

##### **Advantages and limitations of Matching Exercises**

The major advantage of the matching exercise is its compact form, which makes it possible to measure a large amount of related factual material in a relatively short time. This is a mixed bleSSing, however, as it frequently leads to the excessive use of matching exercises and a cOlTesponding overemphasis on the memorization of simple relationships.

Another advantage often cited for the matching exercise is ease of construction. Poormatching items can be rapidly constructed, but good-matching items require a high degree of skill. The correct response for each premise must also serve as a plausible response for the other premises. Any lack of plausibility will reduce the number of possible choices and provide clues to the correct answer. The matching exerdse tends to have more irrelevant clues than any other item type, with the possible exception of the tru~false item.

The main limitations of the matching exercise are that it is restricted to the measurement of facUlal information based on rote learning and that it is highly susceptible to the presence of inelevant clues. Another limitation, somewhat related, is the difficulty of finding homogeneous material that is significant from the viewpoint of our objectives and learning outcomes. For example, we might start out with a few great scientists and their achievements, which we feel all students should know. In order to construct a matclling item, it becomes necessary to add the names and achievements of other, lesser-known scientists. Thus, we find ourselves measuring factual information that was not included in our original test plan and that is far less important than other aspects of knowledge we had intended to include. In short, less significant material is introduced into the test because enough significant, homogeneous material is unavailable. This is a common problem in constructing matching exercises and one not easily avoided. One solution is to begin with multiple-chOice items, because each item can be directly related to a particular outcome, and to switch to the matching form only when homogeneous matelial makes the matching exerdse a more efficient method of measuring the same achievement.

##### Suggestions for Constructing Matching Exercises

Although the matching exercise has only limited usefulness in classroom tests, whenever it is used, spedal effolts should be made to remove irrelevant clues and to arrange it so that tlle student can respond quickly and without confusion. The following suggestions are designed to guide such efforts.

1. Use only homogeneous material in a single matching exercise. This has been mentioned before and is repeated here for emphaSiS. It is without a doubt the most important rule of construction and yet the one most commonly violated. One reason for this is that homogeneity is a matter of degree, and what is homogeneous to one group may be heterogeneous to another. For example, let us assume that we are following the usual suggestion for obtaining homogeneity and develop a matching exercise that includes only men and their achievements. We might end up with a test exercise such as the following one.

EXAMPLE Directions: On the line to the left of each achievement listed in Column A, write the leiter of the man's name in Column B who is noted for that achievement. Each name in Column B may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

 **ColumnA**

- (A) 1. Invented the telephone
- (B) 2. Discovered America
- (C) 3. First United States astronaut to orbit the earth
- (F) 4. First president of the United States

 **ColumnB**

- A. Alexander Graham Bell
- B. Christopher Columbus
- C. John Glenn
- D. Abraham Lincoln
- E. Ferdinand Magellan
- F . George Washington
- G. Eli Whitney

Although the matching exercise in our example may be homogeneous for most students in the primary grades, the discriminations called for are so gross that students above that level will see it as a heterogeneous collection of inventors, explorers, and presidents. Thus, to obtain homogeneity at higher grade levels, it is necessary to have only inventors and their inventions in one matching exercise, explorers and their discoveries in another, and presidents and their achievements in another. At a still higher level, it may be necessary to limit matching exercises still further, such as to inventors whose inventions are in the same field , in order to keep the material homogeneous and free from irrelevant clues. As we ina'ease the level of disa'imination called for in a matching exercise, significant homogeneous material becomes increasingly dlfficult to obtain. Take inventors, for example. How many significant inventions are there in anyone area?

2. Include an unequal nwnber of responses and premises and instmct the student tbat responses may be used once, more than once, or not at all. This will make all the responses eligible for selection for each premise and will decrease the likelihood of successful guessing. When an equal number of responses and premises are llsed and each response is used only once, the probability for guessing the remaining responses correctly is increased eadl tinle a correct answer is selected. TIle odds for correct guessing ina'ease as the list of available responses decreases, and the final response, of course, can be selected entirely on the basis of this process of elimination. In most matdling exerdses, imperfect matching can be obtained by induding more or fewer responses than premises. In either case, the directions should instruct the student that each response may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

3. Keep the list of items to be matd1ed blief and place the shorter responses on the right. A brief list of items is advantageous to both the teacher and the student. From the teacher's standpoint, it is easier to maintain homogeneity in a brief iist. in addition, there is a greater likelihood that the various learning outcomes and subject-matter topiCS will be measured in a balanced manner. Because each matching exerdse must be based on homogeneous material, a long list will reqUire excessive concentration in one area. From dle students' Viewpoint, a brief list enables them to read the responses rapidly and without confusion. Approximately four to seven items in each column seems best. There certainly should be no more than 10 items in either column.

Placing the shorter responses on the right also contributes to more efficient test taking, as it enables students to read the longer premise first and then to scan rapidly dle list of responses.

4. An-ange the list of responses in logical order, place words in alphabetical order, and numbers in sequence. TIlis will contribute to the ease with whid1 the students can scan the responses in seardling for the correct answers. It will also prevent them from detecting possible dues from the arrangement of the responses.

EXAMPLE Directions: On the line to the left of each historical event in Column A, write the letter from Column B that identifies the time period when the event occurred. Each date in Column 8 may be used once, more than once, or not at all.

| Column A |  |                                             | Column B     |  |
|----------|--|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--|
|          |  | (B) 1. Boston Tea Party                     | A. 1765-1769 |  |
|          |  | (A) 2. Repeal of the Stamp Act              | B. 1770-1774 |  |
|          |  | (E) 3. Enactment of the Northwest Ordinance | C. 1775-1779 |
|          |  | (C) 4. Battle of Lexington                  | D. 1780-1784 |
|          |  | (A) 5. Enactment ofTownshend Acts           | E. 1785-1789 |
|          |  | (B) 6. First Continental Congress           |              |
|          |  | (E) 7. United States Constitution drawn up  |              |

This matching exercise also demonstrates the use of fewer responses than premises and the desirability of placing the shortest items on the right.

5. Indicate in the directions the basis for matching the responses and premises. Although the basis for matching is rather obvious in most matching exercises, there are advantages in clearly stating it. First, ambiguity and confusion will be avoided. Second, testing time will be saved because the student will not need to read through the entire list of premises and responses and then "reason out" the basis for matdling.

Special care must be taken when stating directions for matching items. Directions that precisely indicate the basis for matching frequently become long and involved, placing a premium on reading comprehension. For younger students, it may be desirable to give oral directions, put an example on the blackboard, and have tlle students draw lines between the matched items rather than transfer letters.

6. Place all the items for one matching exercise on the same page. This will prevent the disturbance created by 30 or so students switching the pages of the test back and forth. It also will prevent them from missing the responses appearing on another page and generally adds to the speed and efficiency of test administration.

#### **SUMMARY**

The construction of classroom tests, like other phases of teaching, is an art that must be learned. It is not enough to have a knowledge of subject matter, defined learning outcomes, or a psychological understanding of the students' mental processes, although all these are prerequisites. The ability to construct high-quality test items requires a knowledge of the principles and techniques of test construction and skill in their application.

In this chapter, we discussed techniques for constructing short-answer items, true-false or alternative-response items, and matclling exercises. Although these simple forms of objective test items can be made suitable for measuring understanding, thinking skills, and other complex achievements, considerable skill in item constmction is required to go beyond simple knowledge outcomes. Other types of items and tasks are generally more satisfactory for measuring higher-level skills. Thus, the primary use of these simple types of items is in measuring knowledge outcomes.

The short-answer item requires students to supply the appropriate word, phrase, number, or symbol to a direct question or incomplete statement. It can be used for measuring a variety of simple knowledge outcomes, but it is especially useful for measuring problem-solving ability in sdence and mathematics. The ease with which short-answer items can be constructed and their relative freedom from guessing favor their use. However, the areas in which they can be effectively used are restricted by the relatively simple learning outcomes measured and by the fact that the scoring can be contaminated by spelling errors. When shott-answer items are used, the question must be stated clearly and concisely, be free from irrelevant dues, and require an answer that is both brief and definite. Problems reqUiring oflly a number Of a symbol fOf an answef are p'dftiCUlafly adaptable to the shOrt.- answer form.

The true-false item reqUires the student to select one of two possible answers. This item type is used for measuring knowledge outcomes when only two alternatives are possible or the ability to identify the correctness of statements of fact is important. It is also adaptable to measuring the ability to distinguish fact from opinion and the ability to recognize cause-and-effect relationships. The use of true-false items is limited by the diffi-CUlty of constructing clue-free items that measure significant learning outcomes, the susceptibility of this type to guessing, the low reliability of each item, and the general lack of diagnostic value. When the true-false item is used , special effolts must be made to formulate statements that are free from ambiguity, specific determiners, and clues.

The matching exercises consist of two parallel columns of phrases, words, numbers, or symbols that must be matdled. Examples of items induded in matdling exercises are persons and achievements! dates and historical events! and tenus and definitions. The nature of the matching exercise limits it to measuring the ability to identify the relationship between two things. For this restricted use, it is a compact item type that can be used to measure many relationships in a short time. Its limitations include the difficulty of removing irrelevant clues and the difficulty of finding Significant homogeneous material. When homogeneous material is available, including more items in one colunm than in the other, arranging the shorter responses on the right and in logical order, and indicating clearly the basis for matdling all will contribute to the effectiveness of the matching exercise.

#### LEARNING EXERCISES

- 1. Defend the statement "shorr-answer items should not be classified as objective items."
- 2. How would you handle the scoring of shOit-answer items when the answers were misspelled?
- 3. Marking a false statement false does not guarantee that the student knows what is tl1le. How would you handle tlus problem?
- 4. You could expect 50 t11.le-false items to have lower reliability than would 50 shorr-answer items. Why?

### CHAPTER 8: CONSTRUCTING OBJECTIVE TEST ITEMS: MULTIPLE-CHOICE FORMS

![](_page_202_Picture_2.jpeg)

O bjeCtiVe te t items are not limited to the measurement of simple learning ourcomes. The multiple-choice item can measure both knowledge and understanding levels and is free of many of the limitations of other forms of objective items.

The multiple-choice item is generally recognized as the most widely applicable and useful type of objective test item. It can effectively measure many of the simple learning outcomes measured by the short-answer item, the true- false item, and the matching exercise. **In** addition, it can measure a variety of complex outcomes in the knowledge, understanding, and application areas. This flexibility, plus the higher-quality items usually found in the multiple-choice form, has led to its extensive use in achievement testing.

#### **CHARACTERISTICS OF MULTIPLE-CHOICE ITEMS**

A multiple-choice item consists of a problem and a list of suggested solutions. The problem may be stated as a direct question or an incomplete statement and is called the stem of the item. The list of suggested solutions may include words, numbers, symbols, or phrases and are called alternatives (aLso called choices or options). The student is typically requested to read the stem and the list of alternatives and to select the one correct, or best, alternative. The correct alternative in each item is called the answer, and the remaining alternatives are called distracters (also called decoys or foils). These incorrect alternatives receive their name from their intended function: to distract those students who are in doubt about the correct answer.

Whether to use a direct question or incomplete statement in the stem depends on several factors. The direct-question fonn is easier to write, is more natural for younger students, and is more likely to present a clearly formulated problem. On the other hand, the

194

incomplete statement is more concise, and, if skillfully phrased, it too can present a welldefined problem. A common procedure is to start each stem as a direct question and shift to the incomplete-statement form only when the clarity of the problem can be retained and greater conciseness achieved.

 EXAMPLES Direct-Question Form

In which one of the following cities is the capital of California?

- A   Los Angeles
- *B* Sacramento
- C   San Diego
- D   San Francisco

Incomplete-Statement Form

The capital of California is in

- A   Los Angeles.
- *B* Sacramento.
- C   San Diego.
- D   San Francisco.

In these examples, there is only one correct answer. The capital of California is in Sacramento and nowhere else. All other alternatives are wrong. For obvious reasons, this is known as the con-ect-answer type of multiple-chOice item.

Not all knowledge can be stated so precisely that there is only one absolutely con-ect response. In fact, when we get beyond the simple aspects of knowledge, represented by questions of the who, what, whell, and where variety, answers of varying degrees of acceptability are the rule rather than the exception. Questions of the UJby' variety, for example, tend to reveal a number of possible reasons, some of which are better than the others. Likewise, questions of the how variety usually reveal several possible procedures, some of which are more desirable than the others. Measures of acllievement in these areas, then, become a matter of selecting the best answer. This type is especially useful for measuring learning outcomes that require the understanding, application, or intelpretation of factual infonnation. Care must be taken, however, to be certain that the best answer is one agreed on by experts so that the answer can be defended as dearly best.

##### EXAMPLES **BEST-ANSWERTYPE**

Which one of the following factors contributed most to the selection of Sacramento as the capital of Calffornia?

- A Central location
- @ Good climate
- C Good highways
- D Large population
- (or)

Which one of the following factors is given most consideration when selecting a city for a state capital?

- (A) Location
- B Climate
- C Highways
- D Population

What is the most important purpose of city zoning laws?

- A Attract industry
- B Encourage the building of apartments
- (C) Protect property values
- D Provide school "safety zones"

The best-answer type of multiple-choice item tends to be more difficult than the correct-answer type. This is due partly to the finer discriminations called for and partly to the fact that such items are used to measure more complex learning.

#### USES OF MULTIPLE-CHOICE ITEMS

The multiple-choice item is the most versatile type of test item available. It can measure a variety of learning outcomes from simple to complex, and it is adaptable to most types of subject-matter content. It has such wide applicability and so many uses that many standardized tests use multiple-choice items exclusively. This practice is not recommended for classroom testing. Despite the wide applicability of the multiple-choice item, there are learning outcomes, such as the ability to organize and present ideas, that cannot be measured with any form of selection item. For such skills, some form of performance-based assessment is needed (see Chapters 10 and 11).

Because we cannot illustrate all the uses of the multiple-choice item, here we show only its use in measuring some of the more common learning outcomes in the knowledge, understanding, and application areas. The measurement of more complex outcomes, using modified forms of the multiple-choice item, are considered in the following chapter.


##### Measuring Knowledge Outcomes

Learning outcomes in the knowledge area are prominent in all school subjects, and multiple-choice items can measure such a variety of these outcomes that examples can be endless. Here we present the more typical uses of the multiple-choice form in measuring knowledge outcomes common to most school subjects.

Knowledge of Terminology. A simple but basic learning outcome measured by the multiplechoice item is knowledge of terminology. For this purpose, students can be requested to show their knowledge of a particular term by selecting a word that has the same meaning as the given term or by choosing a definition of the term. Special uses of a term also can be measured by having students identify the meaning of the term when used in context.

EXAMPLF.5 Which one of the following words has the same meaning as the word egress?

- A   Depress
- B   Enter
- (C) Exit
- D   Regress

Which one of the following statements best defines the word egress?

- A   An expression of disapproval
- (B) An act of leaving an enclosed place
- C   Proceeding to a higher level
- D   Proceeding to a lower level

What is meant by the word egress in the following sentence: ''The astronauts hope they can now make a safe egress"?

- A   Separation from the rocket
- B   Reentry into the earth's atmosphere
- C   Landing on the water
- (D) Escape from the space capsule

Knowledge of Specific Facts. Another lea rning outcome basic to all school subjects is the knowledge of specific facts. It is important in its own right, and it provides a necessary basis for developing understanding, thinking skills, and other comp lex learning outcomes. Multiple-choice items designed to measure specific facts can take various forms, but questions of the who, what, wlu!II, and whet-e variety are most common. These various types are illustrated in the following examples. Although based on the space program, similar questions could be written in many othe r subject areas.

EXAMPLF.5 Who was the first United States astronaut to orbit the earth in space?

- A   Scott Carpenter
- (B) John Glenn
- C   Virgil Grissom
- D   Alan Shepard

What was the name of the missile that launched the first United States astronaut into orbital flight around the earth?
- (A) Atlas
- B   Mars
- C   Midas
- D   Polaris

When did a United States astronaut first orbit the earth in space?

| A   | 1960 |  |
|---  |------|--|
| B   | 1961 |  |
| (C) | 1962 |  |
| D   | 1963 |  |

Where did the Friendship Seven capsule land after the first United States orbital flight around the earth?

- (A) Atlantic Ocean
- B   Caribbean Sea
- C   Gulf of Mexico
- D   Pacific Ocean

Knowledge of Principles. Knowledge of principles is also an important learning outcome in most school subjects. Multiple-choice items can be constructed to measure knowledge of principles as easily as those designed to measure facts.

EXAMPLF. The principle of capillary action helps explain how fluids

- A   enter solutions of lower concentration.
- B   escape through small openings.
- C   pass through semipermeable membranes.
- (D) rise in fine tubes.

Which one of the following principles of taxation is characteristic of the federal income tax?

- A   The benefits received by an individual should determine the amount of the tax.
- (B) A tax should be based on an individual's ability to pay.
- C   All citizens should be required to pay the same amount of tax.
- D   The amount of tax an individual pays should be determined by the size of the federal budget.

Knowledge of Methods and ProcedUIes. Another common learning outcome readily acceptable to the multiple-choice format is knowledge of methods and procedures. This includes such diverse areas as knowledge of laboratory procedures; knowledge of methods underlying communication, computational, and perfonnance skills; knowledge of methods used in problem solving; knowledge of governmental procedures; and knowledge of common social practices. In some cases, we might want to measure knowledge of procedures before we permit students to practice in a particular area (e.g., laboratory procedures). In od1er cases, knowledge of methods and procedures may be important learning outcomes in their own right (e.g., knowledge of governmental procedures). The following test items illustrate a few of these uses in different school subjects.

EXAMPLF. Which one of the following methods of locating a specimen under the microscope is most desirable?

- A   Start with the coarse adjustment up, and with your eye at the eyepiece, turn down the coarse adjustment.
- (B) Start with the coarse adjustment down, and with your eye at the eyepiece, turn up the coarse adjustment.
- C   Start with the coarse adjustment in the center, and with your eye at the eyepiece, tum up and down until you locate the specimen.

To make treaties, the president of the United States must have the consent of the

- A   Cabinet.
- B   House of Representatives.
- (C) Senate.
- D   Supreme Court.

Alternating electric current is changed to direct current by means of a

- A   condenser.
- B   generator.
- (C) rectifier.
- D   transformer.

If you were making a scientific study of a problem, your first step should be to

- (A) collect information about the problem.
- B   develop hypotheses to be tested.
- C   design the experiment to be conducted.
- D   select scientific equipment.

We have merely soÂ·atched the surface with our examples of multiple-d10ice items measuring knowledge outcomes. AB you develop items in the particular school subjects you teach, many other uses will occur to you.

##### **Measuring Outcomes at the Understanding and Application Levels**

Many teachers limit the use of multiple-dlOice items to the knowledge area because they believe that all objective-type items are restricted to the measurement of relatively simple learning outcomes. Although it is difficult to go beyond the knowledge level with most of the other types of objective items, the multiple-choice item is especially adaptable to the measurement of more complex learning outcomes. The examples that follow illustrate its use in measuring various aspects of understanding and application.

In reviewing the following items, it is important to keep in mind that such items measure learning outcomes beyond factual knowledge only if the applications and interpretations are new to the students. Any spedfic applications or interpretations of knowledge can, of course, be taught directly to students as any other fact is taught. When this is done, and the test items contain the same problem situations and solutions used in teaching, it is obvious that the students can be given credit for no more than the mere retention of factual knOWledge. To measure understanding and application, an element of novelty must be included in the test items. For illustrative purposes, it is necessary to assume that sud1 novelty exists in the examples that follow.

Ability to Identify Application of Facts and Ptinciples. A common method of detennining whether students' learning has gone beyond the mere memorization of a fact or prinCiple is to ask them to identify its correct application in a situation that is new to the student.

Application items measure understanding, but they also include the ability to transfer learning to situations that have not been previously studied. Thus, the items can be designed to measure understanding at a relatively high level.

EX..Â·\MPLES Which one of the following is an example of a chemical element?

- A   Acid

- (A) Fluid is carried through the stems of plants.
- B   Food is manufactured in the leaves of plants.

- D   Plants give off moisture through their stomata.

Pascal's law can be used to explain the operation of

- A   electric fans.
- (B) hydraulic brakes.

- A   The demand for a farm product increased faster than the supply of the product.
- B   The population of a country increased faster than the means of subsistence.
- C   A machine decreased in utility as its parts became worn.
- (D) A factory doubled its labor force and increased production by 50%.

Ability to Interpret Cause-and-Effect Relationships. Understanding can frequently be measured by asking students to interpret various relationships among facts. One of the most important relationships in this regard, and one common to most subject-matter areas, is the cause-and-effect relationship. Understanding of such relationships can be measured by presenting students with a specific cause-and-effect relationship and asking them to identify tlle reason that best accounts for it.

EXAMPLES Bread will not become moldy as rapidly if placed in a refrigerator because

- (A) cooling retards the growth of fungi.
- B   darkness retards the growth of mold.
- C   cooling prevents the bread from drying out so rapidly.
- D   mold requires both heat and light for best growth. D

An increased quantity of carbon monoxide is produced when fuel is burned in a limited supply of oxygen because

- A   carbon reacts with carbon monoxide. A
- (B) carbon reacts with carbon dioxide.

- A   pays higher rates of interest during inflation.
- Ð²   provides a steady but dependable income despite economic conditions.
- C   is protected by the Federal Reserve System.
- (D) increases in value as the value of a business increases.

Ability to Justify Methods and Procedures. Another phase of understanding important in various subject-matter areas concerns methods and procedures. A student might know the correct method or sequence of steps in carrying out a procedure without being able to explain why it is the best method or sequence of steps. At the understanding level, we are interested in the student's ability to justify the use of a particular method or procedure. This can be measured with multiple-choice items by asking the student to select the best of several possible explanations of a method or procedure.

EXAMPLES Why is adequate lighting necessary in a balanced aquarium?

- A Fish need light to see their food.
- B Fish take in oxygen in the dark.
- (C) Plants expel carbon dioxide in the dark.
- D Plants grow too rapidly in the dark.

Why do farmers rotate their crops?

- (A) To conserve the soil.
- B To make marketing easier.
- C To provide for strip cropping.
- D It removes the brownish yellow color.

Although various aspects of understanding and application can be measured by single multiple-choice items, as shown in the preceding examples, a series of multiple-choice items based on a common set of data is even more adaptable to the measurement of complex achievement. Such items are illustrated in the next chapter. CourseSmort

#### **ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF MULTIPLE-CHOICE ITEMS**

The multiple-choice item is one of the most widely applicable test items for measuring achievement. It can effectively measure various types of knowledge and complex learning outcomes. In addition to this flexibility, it is free from some of the common shOltcomings characteristic of the other item types. The ambiguity and vagueness that frequently are present in the short-answer item are avoided because the alternatives better structure the situation. In the following examples, note how the vague short-answer item becomes a clear-cut problem.

| EXAMPLE | *Poor:* Lincoln was born in __________ 
|         | *Better*: Lincoln was born in                                                                          |
|         | A Indiana 
|         | B Illinois 
|         | (C) Kentucky 
|         | D Ohio                                                                

Your first reaction to the short-answer item might be, "Why not put it in question form to make it clearer?" But even if we ask, "In what state was Lincoln born?" answers such as "poverty" could not be ruled out. In addition to clarifying the specific type of resoonse called for. the multiole-cllOice item relieves us of the oroblem of dedclinl? how .1 ' .1 .1 (.J to score misspelled answers. Although we may be interested in having students spell the names of states correctly, this should be done in a separate spelling test rather than letting it contaminate our measures of achievement.

One advantage of the multiple-choice item over the true---false item is that stuclents cannot receive a'edit for simply knowing that a statement is inconectj they must also know what is correct. Note the difference in the following two items.

| EXAMPLE | T | F Lincoln was born in 1807. Lincoln was born in |
|---------|---|-------------------------------------------------------|
|         | A | 1805                                                  |
|         | B | 1807                                                  |
|         | Â© | 1809                                                  |
|         | D | 1811                                                  |
|         |   |                                                       |

In the true-false version, students will receive credit if they mark it false even if they think Lincoln was born in some year other than 1809. In fact, if a student thought he was born in 1909, it would be marked false, and the student would receive a I-point credit for that response. Because marking statements false does not show that students know what is conect, the resulting scores tend to be inadequate measures of what students have learned. This problem is not encountered with multiple-choice items, however, because the students must select the correct answer to receive credit. Although the

problem also could be resolved by having students change all false statements to true, that procedure is often cumbersome, especially when measuring complex learning outcomes.

Using the best-answer type of multiple-choice item also circumvents a difficulty associated with the true-false item--obtaining statements that are true or false without qualification. This makes it possible to measure learning outcomes in the numerous subject-matter areas in whidl solutions to problems are not absolutely true or false but vary in degree of appropriateness (e.g., best method, best reason, and best interpretation).

One other commonly cited advantage of the multiple-choice item over the true-false item is the greater reliability per item. Because the number of alternatives is increased from two to three, four, or five, the opportunity for guessing the correct answer is reduced, and the reliability is correspondingly increased. The effect of increasing the number of alternatives for each item is similar to that of increasing the length of the test. As was noted in Chapter 6, however, this advantage of the multiple-choice item is paltially offset by the fact that roughly three true-false items can typically be responded to in the time it takes to respond to two multiple-choice items.

An advantage of the multiple-choice item over the matching exercise is that the need for homogeneous material is avoided. The matching exercise, which is essentially a modified form of the multiple-dlOice item, requires a series of related ideas to form the list of premises and alternative responses. In many content areas, it is difficult to obtain enough homogeneous material to prepare effective matching exercises. This problem is avoided with multiple-choice items, however, because each item measures a single idea. Thus, it is possible to measure one or many relationships in a given area when the multiple-choice item is used .

tion. First, it is relatively free from response sets. That is, students generally do not favor a particular alternative when they do not know the answer. Second, using a number of plaUSible alternatives makes the results amenable to diagnosis. The kind of incorrect alternatives students select provides dues to factual errors and misunderstandings that need correction.

It is easier to construct high-quality test items in multiple-choice form than in any of the other forms. This does not mean that good multiple-choice items can be constructed without effort, but for a given amount of effort, multiple-choice items will tend to be of a higher quality than short-answer, true-false, or matdling-type items in the same area.

Despite its superiority in many respects to other simple forms of objective items, the multiple-dlOice item has limitations. First, as with all other paper-and-pencil tests, it is limited to learning outcomes at the verbal level. The problems presented to students are verbal problems, free from the many irrelevant factors present in natural situations. In addition, the applications students are asked [Q make are verbal applicatiOns, free from the personal commitment necessalY for application in natural situations. In short, the multiple-dlOice item, like other paper-and-pencil tests, measures whether the student knows or understands what to do when confronted with a problem situation, but it cannot determine how the student actually will perform in that situation.

Second, as with other types of selection items, the multiple-dloice item requires selection of the correct answer, and therefore it is not well adapted to measllring some problem-solving skills in mathematics and science or to measuring the ability to organize and present ideas.

Third, the multiple-choice item has a disadvantage not shared by the other item types: the difficulty of finding a sufficient number of incorrect but plausible distracters. This problem is especially acute at the early primary level because of the sUldents' limited vocabulary and knowledge in any paIticular area. Even at this level, however, classroom teachers have been creative in adapting the multiple-choice item to the measurement of newly learned concepts (see Figure 8.1). As SUI dents move up through the grade levels and expand their vocabulary, knowledge, and understanding, plausible but incorrect answers become more available. It still takes a touch of creativity, however, to identify and state the most plausible distracters that will provide diagnostic information about misunderstandings and incorrect information. This is the task that separates a good test constructor from a poor one. Fomll1ately, the construction of such items gets easier with experience.

#### **SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING MULTIPLE CHOICE ITEMS**

The general applicability and the superior qualities of multiple-dlOice test items are realized most fully when care is taken in their construction. This involves formulating a clearly stated problem, identifying plaUSible alternatives, and removing irrelevant dues to the answer. The following suggestions provide more specific maxims for this purpose.

1. The stem of the item should be meaningful by itself and should present a definite problem. Often the stems of test items placed in multiple-choice form are incomplete statements that make little sense until all the alternatives have been read. These are not multiplechoice items but, rather, a collection of true-false statements placed in multiple-choice form. A properly constructed multiple-choice item presents a definite problem in the stem that is meaningful without the alternatives. Compare the stems in the two versions of the test item in the following example.

| EXAMPLES | Poor:       | South America                                                                                                         |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          | A           | is a flat, arid country.                                                                                              |
|          | B           | imports coffee from the United States.                                                                                |
|          | C           | has a larger population than the United States.                                                                       |
|          | (D)         | was settled mainly by colonists from Spain.                                                                           |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|          | A           | England.                                                                                                              |
|          | B           | France.                                                                                                               |
|          | C           | Holland.                                                                                                              |
|          | (D)         | Spain.                                                                                                                |
|          |             |                                                                                                                       |

Formulating a definite problem in the stem not only improves the stem of the item but also has a desirable effect on the alternatives. In the preceding example, the alternatives in the first version are concerned with widely dissimilar ideas. This heterogeneity is possible because of the stem's lack of structure. In the second version, the clearly formulated problem in the stem forces the alternatives to be more homogeneous.

A good check on the adequacy of the problem statement is to cover the alternatives and read the stern by itself. It should be complete enough to serve as a short-answer item. Starting each item stem as a direct question and shifting to the incompiete-statement rOm1 only when greater conciseness is possible is the most effective method for obtaining a clearly formulated problem.

2. The item stem should include as much of the item as possible and should be free of irrelevant material. This will increase the probability of a clearly stated problem in the stem and will reduce the reading time reqUired. The following example illustrates how the conciseness of an item is increased by removing irrelevant material and induding in the stem those words repeated in the alternatives. Notice that to obtain the conciseness of the final version , it is necessary to shift to the incomplete-statement form. The best version provides

a slim-trim item that is easily read and focuses directly on the key element in the intended learning outcome.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. In testing problem-solving ability, irrelevant material might be included in tI1e stem of an item to determine whether students can identify and select the material that is relevant to t11e problem's solution. Similarly, repeating common words in the alternatives is sometimes necessary for grammatical consistency or greater clarity.

3. Use a negatively stated stem only when significant learning outcomes require it.. Most problems can and should be stated in positive terms. This avoids the pOSSibility of students' overlooking no, flot, least, and sin1ilar words used in negative statements. In most instances, it also avoids measuring relatively insignificant learning outcomes. Knowing the least important method, the principle that does not apply, or the poorest reason are seldom important learning outcomes. We are usually interested in students' learning the most important method, the principle t11at does apply, and the best reason.

Teachers sometimes go to ridiculous extremes to use negatively stated items because they appear more difficuit. The difficuity of such items, however, is in the iack of sentence clarity rather than in the difficulty of the concept being measured.

Both versions of this item measure the same knowledge. But some students who can answer the second version correctly will select an incorrect alternative on the first version merely because the negative phrasing confuses them. Such items thus introduce factors that contribute to the invalidity of the test.

Although negatively stated items are generally to be avoided, there are occasions when they are useful, mainly in areas in which the wrong information or wrong procedure can have dire consequences. In the health area, for example, there are practices to be avoided because of their harmful nature. In shop and laboratOlY work, there are procedures that can damage equipment and result in bodily injury; and in driver training there are unsafe practices to be emphasized. When the avoidance of such potentially hannful practices is emphasized in teaching, it might well receive a corresponding emphasis in testing tluÂ·ough the use of negatively stated items. When used, the negative aspects of the item should be made obvious.

| EXAMPLES | Poor: Which one of the following is not a safe driving practice on icy roads? |  |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
|          | A   Accelerating slowly                                                         |  |

In the first version of the item, the flOt is easily overlooked, in which case students wouid tend to seiect the first alternative and not read any further. In the second version, no student would probably overlook the negative element because it is placed at the end of the statement and is capitalized.

4. All the alternatives should be grammatically consistent with the stem of the item. In the following example, note how the better version results from a change in the alternatives in order to obtain grammatical consistency. This rule is not p resented merely to perpetuate proper grammar usage, however; its main function is to prevent irrelevant clues from creeping in. All too frequently, the grammatical consistency of the correct answer is given attention but that of the distracters is neglected. As a result, some of the

alternatives are grammatically inconsiste nt with the stem and are therefore obviously incorrect answers.

| EXAMPLES | Poor:            | An electric transformer can be used       |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|          |  A   for storing electricity. 
|          | (B)  to increase the voltage of alternating current.
|          |  C   it converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
|          |  D   lternating current is changed to direct current.

|          |  C   convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.
|          |  D   change alternating current to direct current.                  |

Similar difficulties arise from a lack of attention to verb tense, to the proper use of the articles *a* or *atl,* and to other common sources of grammatical inconsistency. Because most of these errors are the result of carelessness, they can be detected easily by carefully reading each item before assembling them into a test. See the box "How Many Alternatives Should Be Used in Multiple-Choice Items?" for more guidelines on constructing multiple-dloice assessments.

one correct answer in a test item and asking students to select all the correct alternatives has two shortcomings. First, such items are usually no more than a collection of true-false items presented in multiple-dlOice format. They do not present a definite problem in the stem, and the selection of answers requires a mental response of *h-ue orfalse* to each alternative rather than a comparison and selection of alternatives. Second , because the number of alternatives selected as correct answers varies from one student to another, satisfactory scoring methods are more cumbersome than most teachers are likely to want to use or have to explain to students.

| EXAMPLES | Poor:     |  The state of Michigan borders on |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
|          | (A)       | Lake Huron.               |                                  |
|          |  B        | Lake Ontario.             |                                  |
|          | (C)       | Indiana.                  |                                  |
|          |  D        | Illinois.                 |                                  |
|          | Better:   | The state of Michigan borders on |
|          | A         | Lake Huron.               | (T) F                            |
|          | B         | Lake Ontario.             |  T  (f)                          |
|          | C         | Indiana.                  | (T) F                            |
|          | D         | Illinois.                 |  T  (f)                          |
|          |           |                           |                                  |

The second version of this item shows students what type of response is expected. They are to read eadl alternative and decide whether it is true or false. Thus, this is not a four-alternative, multiple-dlOice item but a series of four statements, eadl of which has two alternatives---true or false. This second version, which is called a duster-type true-false item, not only identifies the mental process involved but also simplifies the scoring. Each statement in dle duster can be considered as 1 point and scored as any oilier true-false item is scored. In contrast, how would you score a student who selected alternatives A, B, and C in dle first version? Would you give 2 points for the response because two answers were correctly identified? Would you give only 1 point because one incorrect alternative was also selected? Or would you give no points because ilie answer as a whole was not completely correct? How would you evaluate me lack of a response to alternative D? Assume that ilie student knew illinois did not border on Michigan and therefore did not select it or assume d1at me student was uncertain and left it blank. Fairly complicated and cumbersome scoring rules are required to satisfactorily resolve these problems. Hence, multiple-dl0ice items like dle one in me first version should be avoided or converted to the true-false form.

There is anotller important facet of this rule concerning single-answer multiplechoice items: The answer must be agreed on by aumOIities in ilie area. The best-answer type of item is especially subject to variations of interpretation and disagreement concerning the correct answer. Care must be taken to make certain dlat ilie answer is dearly the best one. Frequendy, rewording the problem in tlle stem will correct an otherwise faulty item.

In the first version of ilie following item, different alternatives could be defended as correct, depending on whetller the *best* refers to cost, efficiency, cleanliness, or acces-Sibility. The second version avoids iliis problem by making dle criterion of *best* explicit.

6. Items llsed to measure lmderstanding sbould contain some novelty, but beware of too much. The construction of multiple-choice items mat measure understanding reqUires a careful choice of situations and skillful phrasing. The situations must be new to the students but not too far removed from the examples used in dass. If me test items contain problem situations identical with those lLsed in dass, me students can, of course, respond on the basis of memorized answers. On me oilier hand, if the problem situations contain too much novelty, some students may respond incorrectly merely because tlley lack necessary factual

##### How Many Alternatives Should Be Used in Multiple-Choice Items?

There is no magic number of alternatives to use in a multiple-choice item. Typically three, four, or five choices are used. Some favor five-dl0ice items to reduce the chances of guessing the correct answer.

| Number of    | Chances of a  | Chance Score    |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Choices      | Correct Guess | on 100-ItemTest |
| Five         | l in 5        | W               |
| choice items |               |                 |
| Four         | l in 4        | 25              |
| choice items |               |                 |
| Three        | 1 in 3        | 33              |
| choice items |               |                 |

Reducing the chances of guessing tbe correct answers by adding alternatives enllances reliability and validity, but only if all the distracters are plausible and the items are well constructed. Our preference is for using fourchoice items because, with reasonable effort, three good distracteJ's usually can be obtained (a fourth distracter tends to be difficult to devise and is usually weaker than the others). For young students, three-dloice items may be preferable in order to reduce the amount of reading. It should also be noted that there is a trade-off between the number of items and the number of choices per item. A 50-item test with tIu-ee choices per item is likely to produce a more valid and reliable test than a 40-item test with five choices per item, especially if the fourth distractor is not very plausible for many of the items.

The number of alternatives can, of course, valY from item to item. You might use a fivechoice item when four good distracters are available and a three-choice item when there are only two. Do not give up too soon on constructing distracters, however. It takes time and effort to generate several good ones.

infonnation about the situations used. Asking students to apply the law of supply and demand to some phase of banking, for example, would be grossly unfair if they had not had a previous oppoltLmity to study banking polides and practices. They may have a good understanding of the law of supply and demand but be unable to demonstrate tillS because of their unfamiliarity with tl1e particular situation selected.

The problem of too much novelty usually can be avoided by selecting situations from the student'S everyday experiences, by induding in the stem of the item any facmal information needed, and by phrasing the item so that the type of application or interpretation called for is dear.

7. All distracters should be plausible. The purpose of a distracter is to distract the uninformed from the correct answer. To the smdent who has not achieved the learning outcome being tested, the distracters should be at least as attractive as tile correct answer and preferably more so. In a properly constructed multiple-dloice item, each distracter will be selected by some smdents. If a distracter is not selected by anyone, it is not contributing to tile functioning of tile item and should be eliminated or revised.

One factor contributing to the plausibility of distracters is their homogeneity. If all the alternatives are homogeneous with regard to the knowledge being measured, then the distracters are more Likely to function as intended. Whether alternatives appear homogeneous and distracters plausible, however, also depends on the students' age level. Note the difference in homogeneity in the following two items.

| EXAMPLE | Poor:   | Who discovered the North Pole?             |  |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------|--|
|         | A       | Christopher Columbus                       |  |
|         | B       | Ferdinand Magellan                         |  |
|         | (C)     | Robert Peary                               |  |
|         | D       | Marco Polo                                 |  |
|         | Better: | Who discovered the North Pole?             |  |
|         | A       | Roald Amundsen                             |  |
|         | B       | Richard Byrd                               |  |
|         | (C)     | Robert Peary                               |  |
|         | D       | Robert Scott                               |  |

The first version would probably appear homogeneous to students at the primary level because all four choices are the names of well-known explorers. Students in higher grades, however, would eliminate alternatives A, B, and D as possible answers because they would know these men were not polar explorers. They might also recall that these men lived several hundred years before the North Pole was discovered. In either case, they could quickly obtain the correct answer by the process of elimination. The second version indudes only the names of polar explorers, all of whom were active at approximately the same time. This homogeneity makes each alternative much more plaUSible and the elimination process much less effective. It also, of course, ina-eases the item's level of difficulty. See the "Guidelines" box.

In selecting plaUSible distracters, the students' learning experiences must not be ignored. In the foregoing item, for example, the dist:racters in the second version would not be plaUSible to students if Robert Peary was the only polar explorer they had studied. Obviously, distracters must be familiar to students before they can serve as reasonable alternatives. Less obvious is the rich source of plaUSible distracters provided by the students' learning experiences. Common misconceptions, errors of judgment, and faulty reasoning that occur during the teadling-Iearning process provide the most plaUSible and educationally sound distracters available. One way to tap this supply is to keep a running record of such errors. A quicker method is to administer a short-answer test to students and tabulate the most common errors. This provides a series of incorrect responses that are especially plaUSible because they are in the students' own language.

8. Verbal associations between the stem and the correct answer should be avoided. Frequently a word in the correct answer will provide an irrelevant due because it looks or sounds like a word in the stem of the item. Such verbal associations should never permit the student who lacks the necessary achievement to select the correct answer. However, words similar to tllose in the stem might be included in the distracters to increase their plaUSibility. Students who depend on rote memory and verbal associations will then be

GUIDELINES
 Ways to Make Distracters Plausible
- 1. Use the students' most common errors.
- 2. Use important-sounding words (e.g. , significan~ *accurate)* that are relevant to the item stem. But do not overdo it!
- 3. Use words that have verbal associations with the item stem (e.g. , *politician, political).*
- 4. Use textbook language or other phraseology that has the appearance of truth.
- 5. Use incorrect answers that are likely to result from student misunderstanding or carelessness (e.g., forgets to convert from feet to yards).
- 6. Use distracters that are homogeneous and similar in content to the correct answer (e.g., all are inventors).
- 7. Use distracters that are parallel in form and grammatically consistent with the item's stem.
- 8. Make the distracters similar to the correct answer in length, vocabulary, sentence structure, and complexity of thought

CAUTION: Distracters should distract the uninformed, but they should not result in trick questions that mislead knowledgeable students (e.g., do *not*  insert *not* in a correct answer to make it a distracter).

led away from, rat11er than to, the correct answer. The following item, taken from a fifthgrade test on a weather unit, shows the incorrect and correct use of verbal associations between the stem and the alternatives.

| EXAMPLE | Poor:            | Which one of the following agencies should you contact to find out about a tornado warning in your locality? |  |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
|         | A                | State farm bureau
|         | (B)              | Local radio station
|         | c                | United States Post Office
|         | D                | United States Weather Bureau           |  |
|         | Better:          | Which one of the following agencies should you contact to find out about a tornado warning in your locality? |  |
|         | A                | Local farm bureau 
|         | (B)              | Nearest radio station 
|         | C                | Local post office
|         | D                | United States Weather Bureau                 |  |

In the first version, the association between locality and local is an unnecessary clue. In the second version, this verbal association is used in two distracters to make them more attractive choices. If irrelevant verbal associations in the distracters are overused, however, students will soon catch on and avoid alternatives with pat verbal associations.

9. The relative length of the alternatives should not provide a clue to the answer. The best we can hope for in equalizing the length of a test item's alternatives is to make them approximately equal. Because the correct answer usually needs to be qualified, however, it tends to be longer than the distracters unless a special effort is made to control the length of the alternatives. If the correct answer cannot be shortened, then the distracters can be expanded to the desired length. Lengthening the distracters also is desirable for another reason. Added qualifiers and greater specificity frequently contribute to their plausibility. The correct answer should not be consistently longer, or consistently shorter, or consistently of medium length. The relative length of the correct answer should vary from one item to another in such a manner that no pattern is discernible to indicate the answer. This means, of course, that sometimes the correct answer will be the longest.

| EXAMPLE | Poor: What is the major purpose of the United Nations?                                  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         | A To maintain peace among the peoples of the world                                        |
|         | B To establish international aw                                                         |
|         | C To provide military control                                                           |
|         | D To form new governments                                                               |
|         | Better: What is the major purpose of the United Nations?                                |
|         | To maintain peace among the peoples of the world A                                      |
|         | B To develop a new system of international law                                          |
|         | C To provide military control of nations that have recently attained their independence |
|         | D To establish and maintain democratic forms of government in newly formed nations         |

10. The correct answer should appear in each of the alternative positions an approximately equal number of times but in random order. Some teachers often bury the correct answer in the middle of the list of alternatives. As a consequence, the correct answer appears in the first and last positions far less often than it does in the middle positions. This, of course, provides an irrelevant clue to the alert student.

In placing the correct answer in each position approximately an equal number of times, care must be taken to avoid a regular pattern of responses. A random placement of correct answers can be attained with the use of any book. For each test item, open the book at an arbitrary position, note the number on the right-hand page, and place the correct answer for that test item as follows:

| If Page Number  | Place Correct |  |  |  |
|-----------------|---------------|--|--|--|
| Ends in         | Answer        |  |  |  |
| 1               | First         |  |  |  |
| 3               | Second        |  |  |  |
| 5               | Third         |  |  |  |
| 7               | Fourth        |  |  |  |
| 9               | Fifth         |  |  |  |

11. Use sparingly special alternatives such as "none of the above" or "all of the above." The phrases "none of the above" or "all of the above" are sometimes added as the last alternative in multiple-choice items. This is done to force the student to consider all the alternatives carefully and to increase the difficulty of the items. All too frequently, however, these special alternatives are used inappropriately. In fact, there are relatively few situations in which their use is appropriate.

The use of "none of the above" is restricted to the correct-answer type of multiplechoice items and consequently to the measurement of factual knowledge to which absolute standards of correctness can be applied. It is inappropriate in best-answer types of items because the student is told to select the best of several alternatives of varying degrees of correctness.

Use of "none of the above" is frequently recommended for items measuring computational skill in mathematics and spelling ability, but these learning outcomes generally should not be measured by multiple-choice items, because they can be measured more effectively by short-answer items. When "none of the above" is used in such situations, the item may measure nothing more than a student's ability to recognize incorrect answers, a rather inadequate basis for judging computational skill or spelling ability.

The alternative "none of the above" should be used only when the measurement of significant learning outcomes requires it. As with negatively stated item stems, sometimes procedures or practices should be avoided for safety, health, or other reasons. When knowing what not to do is important, "none of the above" might be appropriately applied. When used for this purpose, it also must be used as an incorrect answer a proportionate number of times. See the box "Examples of Misuse of the Alternative 'None of the Above.'"

The use of "all of the above" is fraught with so many difficulties that it might best be discarded as a possible alternative. When used, some students will note that the first alternative is correct and select it without reading further. Other students will note that at least two of the alternatives are correct and thereby know that "all of the above" must be the answer. In the first instance, students mark the item incorrectly because they do not read all the alternatives, and in the second instance, students obtain the correct answer on the basis of partial knowledge. Both types of response prevent the item from functioning as intended.

12. Do not use multiple-choice items when other item types are more appropriate. When various item types can serve a purpose equally well, the multiple-choice item should be favored because of its many superior qualities. Sometimes, however, the multiple-choice form is inappropriate or less suitable than other item types. When there are only two possible responses (e.g., fact or opinion), the true-false item is more appropriate. When there are enough homogeneous items but few plausible distracters for each, a matching exercise might be more suitable. In certain problem-solving situations in mathematics and science, for example, supply types of short-answer items are clearly superior. The measurement of many complex achievement goals (such as organizing, integrating, and expressing ideas; the formulation and testing of hypotheses; or the construction of models, maps, or diagrams) requires the use of performance-based assessment tasks. Although we should take full advantage of the wide applicability of the multiple-choice form, we should not lose sight of a principle of test construction cited earlierselect the item type that measures the learning outcome. One of the primary criticisms of high-stakes assessments, an overreliance on multiple-choice items, is not

really a criticism of multiple-choice items per se but a criticism of the lack of measurement of other types of learning outcomes that are better measured by other types of items. See the "Checklist" box.

#### **SUMMARY**

The multiple-choice item consists of a problem and a list of alternative solutions. The student responds by selecting the alternative that provides the correct or best solution to the problem. The incorrect alternatives are called distracters because their purpose is to distract the uninformed student from the correct response. The problem can be stated as a direct question or an incomplete statement. In either case, it should be a clearly formulated problem that is meaningful without reference to the list of alternatives.

The multiple-choice form is extremely flexible and can be used to measure a variety of learning outcomes at the knowledge and understanding levels. Knowledge outcomes concerned with vocabulary, facts, principles, and methods and procedures all can be measured with the multiple-choice item. ASpects of understanding, such as the application and interpretation of facts, principles, and methods, also can be measured with this item type. Other, more specific uses occur in particular school subjects.

The main advantage of the multiple-choice item is its wide applicability in the measurement of various phases of achievement. It is also free of many of the limitations of other forms of objective items. It tends to present a more well-defined problem than the short-answer item does, it avoids the need for homogeneous material reqUired by the matching item, and it reduces the clues and susceptibility to guessing characteristic of the true-false item. In addition, the multiple-chOice item is relatively free from response sets and is useful in diagnosis.

Its limitations are mainly that it is a selection type of paper-and-pencil test and measures problem-solving behavior at the verbal level only. Because it reqUires selection of the correct answer, it is inappropriate for measuring learning outcomes reqUiring the ability to recall, organize, synthesize, or evaluate ideas.

The construction of multiple-chOice items involves defining the problem in the stem of the item, selecting one correct or best solution, identifying several plaUSible distracters, and avoiding irrelevant clues to the answer. Items used to measure learning outcomes at the understanding level must also include some (but beware of too much) novelty.

### CHAPTER 9: MEASURING COMPLEX ACHIEVEMENT: THE INTERPRETIVE EXERCISE**

C omPlex achievement include those learning outcomes based on the higher mental processes, such as understanding, thinking skills, and various problem-solving abilities. Although some aspects of complex achievement require e:ll.1ended constructed responses and other types of performance assessment tasks, other aspects can be measured objectively.

We have already had some experience with measuring complex achievement, as this categOlY encompasses all those learning outcomes requiring more than the mere retention of factual knowledge. The use of the sholt-answer item to measure problem-solving abilities in mathematics and science, the true-false item to measure the ability to recognize cause-and-effect relationships, and the multiple-choice item to measure various aspects of understanding and application all illustrate the measurement of complex achievement. These illustrations, however, were limited to the use of single, independent test items of the objective type. Greater range and flexibility in measuring complex achievement can be attained not only by moving to the extended response and other performance assessment tasks discussed in Chapters 10 and 11 but also by using more complex forms of objective test items.

A variety of leaming outcomes are included in complex achievement. Following are typical examples.

- Ability to apply a principle
- Ability to interpret relationships
- Ability to recognize and state inferences
- Ability to recognize the relevance of information
- Ability to develop and recognize tenable hypotheses
- Ability to formulate and recognize valid conclusions
- Ability to recognize assumptions underlying conclusions
- Ability to recognize the limitations of data
- Ability to recognize and state significant problems
- Ability to design experimental procedures
- Ability to interpret clutts, tables, and data
- Ability to evaluate arguments

These and similar learning outcomes have been classified under such categories as understanding, reasoning, critical thinking, sdentific thinking, creative thinking, and problem solving. There is general agreement that leaming outcomes based on higher-order thinking skills constitute some of the most significant outcomes of education. Given the importance of these complex learning outcomes, it is critical to use a full an-ay of assessment techniques available for measuring those outcomes. The interpretive exerdse provides one of those needed teclllliques. Used wisely, and supplemented by the techniques discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, the interpretive exercise can help ensure that complex learning outcomes are given adequate priority in classroom assessments.

#### **NATURE OF THE INTERPRETIVE EXERCISE**

An interpretive exerdse (also called "classification exercise," "key-type item," or "master-list item'') consists of a series of objective items based on a common set of stimuli. The stimuli may be in the form of written materials, tables, chal1s, graphs, maps, or pictures. The series of related test items may also take various forms but are most commonly multiple-choice or tme-false items. Because all students are presented with a conunon set of stimuli, it is possible to measure a variety of complex leaming outcomes. Students can be asked to identify relationships in data, to recognize valid conclUSions, to appraise assumptions and inferences to detect proper applications of data, and the like.

The common set of materials lIsed in interpretive exercises ensures that all students will be confronted with the same task. It also makes it possible to control the amount of factual infonnation given to them. We can give them as much or as little infonnation as we think desirable in measuring their acllievement of a learning outcome. In measuring their ability to interpret mathematical data, for exanlple, we can include the formu las needed or require the students to supply them. In other areas, we can supply definitions of terms, meanings of symbols, and other facts or expect students to supply them. *The flexibility makes it possible to measure various degrees of proficiency in any palticular area.

#### **FORMS AND USES OF THE INTERPRETIVE EXERCISE**

As with other objective items, there are so many forms and uses of the interpretive exercise that it is impossible to illustrate all of them. Here we present examples of this item type as applied to the measurement of complex learning outcomes in a variety of school

120 Part II Classroom Tests and Assessments

subjects at the elementary and secondalY levels. Different types of introductory material and different methods of responding also will be used to illustrate the great flexibility of the interpretive exercise. The references at the end of this chapter offer additional illustrative exercises.

##### Ability to Recognize Inferences

In interpreting written material, it is frequently necessaty to draw inferences from the facts given. The following exercise measures the extent to which students are able to recognize warranted and unwarranted inferences drawn from a passage.

EXamPLE *Directions:* Assuming that the information below is true, it is possible to establish other facts using the ones in this paragraph as a basis for reasoning. This is called drawing inferences. There is, of course, a limit to the number of kinds of facts which may be properly inferred from any statement.

> By writing the proper symbol in the space provided, indicate that a statement is TRUE if it may be properly inferred from the information given in the paragraph. Indicate that it is UNTRUE if the information given in the paragraph implies that it is false. Indicate that NO INFERENCE can be drawn if the statement cannot be inferred one way or the other. Use only the information given in the paragraph as a basis for your responses ....

 Use the following symbols in writing your answers:

T -if the statement may be inferred as TRUE.
F -if statement may b e inferred as UNTRUE
N -if NO INFERENCE can be drawn about it from the paragraph.

 **PARAGRAPH A**

By the close of the thirteenth century there were several famous universities established in Europe, though of course they were very different from modern ones. One of the earliest to be founded was one of the most widely known. This was the University of Bologna, where students from all countries came who wished to have the best training in studying Roman law. Students especially interested in philosophy and theology went to the University of Paris. Those who wished to study medicine went to the Universities of Montpellier or Salerno.

 **QUESTIONS ON PARAGRAPH A**

- (T) 1. There were law suits between people occasionally in those days.
- (N) 2. The professors were poorly paid.
- (F) 3. In the Middle Ages people were not interested in getting education.
- (T) 4. There were books in Europe at that time.
- (N) 5. Most of the teaching in these medieval universities was very poor.
- (N) 6. There was no place where students could go to study.
- (F) 7. There were no doctors in Europe at this time.
- (F) 8. There was no way to travel during the Middle Ages.
- (T) 9. If a student wanted to be a priest, he would probably attend the University of Paris.
- (N) 10. There were no universities in Europe before the thirteenth century.

##### Ability to Recognize Warranted and Unwarranted Generalizations

The ability to recognize the validity of generalizations is of central impottance in the interpretation of data. At minimum, students should be able to determine which conclusions the data SUppOlt, which the data refute, and whicll the data neither support nor refu te. The data may be in the form of tables, chalts, graphs, maps, or pictures, and the test items may be ttue-fa1se or multiple-choice items. An illuStlo.tion of recognizing the validity of generalizations is shown in the following example.

EXAMPLE Percentage of population between the ages of 25 and 29 who have completed secondary and college (a bachelor's degree or higher education), by gender in 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995,2000, and 2005

|      | Males       |         | Females     |         |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Year | High School | College | High School | College |
| 1980 | 85.4        | 24.0    | 85.5        | 21 .0   |
| 1985 | 85.9        | 23.1    | 86.4        | 21.3    |
| 1990 | 84.4        | 23.7    | 87.0        | 22.8    |
| 1995 | 86.3        | 24.5    | 87.4        | 24.9    |
| 2000 | 86.7        | 27.9    | 89.4        | 30.1    |
| 2005 | 84.9        | 25.3    | 87.3        | 32.0    |

Directions: The following statements refer to the data in the table above. Read each statement and mark your answer according to the following key.

Circle:

S if the statement is Supported by the data in the table.
R if the statement is Refuted by the data in the table.
N if the statement is Neither supported nor refuted by the data.

| (S) |  R  |  N  | 1. The discrepancy in percentage completion of higher education for males and females between the ages of 25 and 29 was smaller in 1995 than it was any of the 
|     |     |     |    other years shown in the table.  |
| S   |  R  | (N) | 2. Since 2000, college admissions policies give preferential treatment to female applicants over male applicants. |
| S   |  R  | (N) | 3. It was more difficult to get into college in the 1980s and 19905 than it is today.  |
| S   | (R) |  N  | 4. When males and females are combined, the percentage for young adults between the ages of 25 and 29 who have completed high school has increased every year | 
|     |     |     | over what it was 5 years earlier. |

##### Ability to Recognize Assumptions

Another learning outcome pertinent to the inte rpretation of various types of information is the ability to identify unstated assumptions that are necessary to a conclusion or course of action . The following item illustrates tl1is type of interpretive exercise.

EXAMPLE Studies have shown that there is a relationship between vocabulary and crime. Crime rates are higher for people with poorly developed vocabularies, and crime rates are lower for people with well-developed vocabularies. Older studies have also shown that there is a positive relationship between the number of years of Latin studied and the size and preciseness of an individual's vocabulary. Conclusion: Crime rates can be lowered tty reintroducing the study of Latin in the schools.

Which one of the following assumptions is necessary to reach such a conclusion?

- A Correlational methods were used to determine these relationships.
- B These reported relationships were statistically significant.
- (C) Relationships such as these imply causation.
- D Latin scholars have a low crime rate.

##### Ability to Recognize the Relevance of Information

A learning outcome impOltant to all subject-matter areas and that can be measured at all levels of instruction is the ability to recognize the relevance of information. The exercise presented here was prepared for third-grade students.

EXAMPLE Bill lost his boot on the way to school. He wanted to put a notice on the bulletin board so that the other children could help him find it. Which of the following sentences tell something that would help children find the boot?

*Direcvons:* Circle *yes* if it would help. Circle *no* if it would not help.

- (yes) no  1.  The boot was black. 
-  yes (no) 2. It was very warm .
- (yes) no  3. It was for his right foot.
-  yes (no) 4. It was a Christmas present.
-  yes (no) 5. It was nice looking.
- (yes) no  6. It had a zipper.
- (yes) no  7. It had a gray lining.

##### Ability to Apply Principles

The application of principles may be shown in many different ways. In the following example, students are asked to identify prindples that explain a situation and to recognize illustrations of a principle .

EXAMl>LE Mary Ann wanted her rose bush to grow faster, so she applied twice as much chemical fertilizer as was recommended and watered the bush every evening. About a month later she noticed that the rose bush was dying.

*Directions:* Which of the following principles is necessary in explaining why the rose bush is dying? If a principle is Necessary, circle N; if a principle is Unnecessary, circle U.

- N (U) 1. A chemical compound is changed into other compounds by taking up the elements of water.
- (N) U 2. Semipermeable membranes permit the passage of fluid.
- N (U) 3. Water condenses when cooled.
- (N) U 4. When two solutions of different concentration are separated by a porous partition, their concentration tends to equalize.

##### Use of Pictorial Materials

Pictorial materials can serve two useful purposes in interpretive exercises. First, they can help measure a variety of learning outcomes similar to those already discussed simply by repladng the written or tabular data with a pictorial presentation. This use is especially desi.rable with younger students and when ideas can be more clearly conveyed in pictorial form. Second, pictorial materials can also measure the ability to interpret graphs, cartoons, maps, and other pictorial materials. In many school subjects, these are impOltant learning outcomes in their own right.

The following examples illustrate the use of pictorial materials.

These three examples were designed for use in lower grades. They illustrate the lise of pictorial materials that can be drawn by the teacher and items that are useful for measuring rather simple interpretations of concepts and relationships.

Examples IV and V are interpretive exercises designed for higher grade levels. They are included here to illustrate the use of various types of pictorial materials, the measurement of different types of learning outcomes, and the use of both multiple-choice and tme-false items. As noted in these examples, the pictures and diagrams used in an interpretive exercise frequently can be obtained from published sources. When this is done, care must be taken in reproducing the pictorial elements to make certain that they are clear and detailed enough for proper interpretation. It is also impoltant, of course, to be aware of the copyright laws that govern the use of the material. However, there is seldom a problem in obtaining permission to reproduce copyrighted materials for classroom use.

Cartoons like the one in Example IV can be found in newspapers and news magazines. Then simply prepare questions that require the desired interpretations. Either true--false or multiple-dlOice items might be used with this type of exercise. It is important to select a caltoon that illustmtes a concept or principle that is relevant to the learning outcomes to be measured. Interpretive exercises of this type are especially useful in social studies.

A chaIt like that in Example V is typically easy to prepare but may sometimes be found in published sources. Maps and diagrams that contain data also make effective materials for interpretive exercises.

#### **ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF INTERPRETIVE EXERCISES**

The interpretive exercise has several advantages. First, the introdUctOlY material makes it p0ssible to measure the ability to interpret written materials, chalts, graphs, maps, pictures, and other communication media encountered in everyday situations. The rapid expansion of knowledge in every subject-matter area has made it imposSible to learn all the important factual infonnation in a given field, whidl has led to greater dependence on the internet, libraries, reference materials, self-study techniques, and interpretive skills. Second, the interpretive exercise makes it possible to measure more complex learning outcomes than can be measured with the single objective item. Some data are usually necessary if students are to demonstrate thinking and problem-solving skills, and the inclusion of such data is awkward in most kinds of test items. Third, by having a seIies of related test items based on a common set of data , greater depth and breadth can be obtained in the measurement of achievement skills. FOUlth, the interpretive exercise minimizes the influence of inÂ·elevant factual information on the measurement of complex learning outcomes. Students may be unable to demonstrate their understanding of a pIinciple simply because they do not know some of the facts concerning the situation to whidl they are to be applied. This blocking of response, caused by a lack of detailed factual information not directly pertinent to the purpose of the measurement, can be largely eliminated with the interpretive exercise. **In** the introductory mateIials, we can give students the common background of information needed to demonstrate understanding, thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities.

The interpretive exercise is more structured than performance assessment tasks. Whether this is an advantage or disadvantage depends on the specific outcomes to be measured. Students are not free to redefine the problem or to demonstrate thinking skills at which they are most efficient on an interpretive exercise. The series of objective items forces them to use only the mental processes called for. This also makes it possible to measure separate aspects of problem-solving ability and to use objective scoring procedures. This structure has advantages for focusing the task on a specific outcome, SUcll as the ability to identify assumptions underlying conclusions. For other types of outcomes, however, the structure may make it impossible to adequately assess the desired outcome. For example, an interpretive exercise would not be suitable for measuring whether students are able to generate the assumptions underlying a conclusion.

As with all fonns of test items, the intetpretive exercise has Cettain limitations. Probably the greatest limiting factor, and one that may have occunÂ·ed to you as you reviewed the sample items, is the difficulty of constnlction. Selecting printed mateIials that are new to the students but relevant to the instmctional outcomes requires considerable searcl1ing. When pertinent mateIiaI is found, it usually must be edited and reworked to make it more suitable for testing pUlposes.

Next, test items must be construct.ed that demand the specific behaviors indicated in the learning outcomes being measured. The construction process is often circular (Le. , it goes back and forth between revising the introductory material and revising the test items until a satisfactOly product is obtained). TIlis entire procedure is time consuming and requires much greater skill than that needed to construct single objective test items. Three positive comments can be lnade regarding the difficulty of constructing interpretive exercises, however. First, more and more items of this type now appear in vaIious subject-matter fields. The references at the end of this chapter contain numerous examples that may serve as guides to test construction.

Second, the greater instructional emphasis on complex learning outcomes resulting from the use of interpretive exercises offsets the additional effort required in test construction. Finally, the task becomes easier with practice and experience.

A second limitation, especially pertinent when the introductOlY material is in written form, is the heavy demand on reading skill. The poor reader is handicapped by both the difficulty of the reading material and the length of time it takes to read each test exercise. The first problem can be controlled somewhat by keeping the reading level low and the second by using brief passages. Both of these are only partial solutions, however, because the poor reader will still be at a decided disadvantage. In the primaty grades and in classes that contain many poor readers, interpretive exercises might be better limited to the use of pictorial materials.

Compared to the extended essay questions and perfonnance-based assessment tasks discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, the interpretive exercise has two shottcomings as a measure of complex achievement. First, it cannot measure a student'S overall approach to problem solving. It is efficient for measuring specific aspects of the problem-solving process, but it does not indicate whether the student can integrate and use these skills when faced with a particular problem. Thus, it provides a diagnostic view of the students' problem-solving abilities in contrast with the holistic view of essay questions or other performance assessment tasks.

Second, because the interpretive exercise normally uses selection items, it is confined to learning outcomes at the recognition level. To measure the ability to define problems, to fonnulate hypotheses, to organize data, and to draw conclusions, perfonnance assessment tasks mllst be used. Clearly, the interpretive exercise is not suitable for assessing a student's ability to communicate effectively in writing, perform an experiment, create a work of art, or make an oral presentation to a group. Essay questions and performance assessments tasks are needed for sllch outcomes. Nonetheless, the interpretive exercise is a valuable technique that can contribute to the valid measurement of complex outcomes.

#### **SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING INTERPRETIVE EXERCISES**

The two main tasks in constmcting interpretive exercises are (1) selecting appropriate introductory material, and (2) constructing a series of dependent test items. In addition, care must be taken to construct test items that require analyzing the introductory material in terms of complex learning outcomes. The following suggestions will aid in constructing high-quality interpretive exercises.

1. Select introductory material that is relevant to tbe objectives of the course. Interpretive exercises, like other testing procedures, should measure the achievement of specific instructional outcomes. Success in this regard depends to a large extent on the introductolY mateIial, as this provides the common basis for the test items. If the introductory matelial is too simple, then the exercise may become a measure of general information or simple reading skilL On the other hand, if the material is too complex or umelated to instructional goals, then it may become a measure of general reasoning ability. Both extremes must be avoided. Ideally, the introductory material should be pertinent to the course content and complex enough to evoke the mental reactions specified in the course objectives.

The amount of emphasis given to the various interpretive skills in the course objectives is also important. Care must be taken not to overload the test with interpretive items in any particular area. The selection of introductory material should be gUided by the emphasis to be given to the measurement of complex achievement and each type of interpretive skill.

2. Select introductory material that is appropriate to the students' curricular experience and reading level. Many complex learning outcomes can be measured with different types of introductory material. The ability to recognize the validity of conclusions, for example, can be measured with written materials, tables, clurts, graphs, maps, or pictures. The type used should be familiar to the students so that the nature of the material does not prevent them from demonstrating their achievement of the complex learning outcomes. It would be unfair, for example, to ask students to recognize the validity of conclusions on the basis of data presented in graph form if they had not had experience in interpreting graphs similar to those used in the test. When various types of introductOlY material will serve a purpose equally well and all are familiar to the students, we favor material that places the least demand on reading skill. For elementary students, pictorial materials are definitely favored. For higher grade levels, pictorial materials and verbal materials with a low vocabulary load and simple sentences are preferred. Although general reading skill is necessary in all written tests, it can become prominent in interpretive exercises unless effOlts are made to minimize its influence.

3. Select introductory matel;al that is new to students. In order to measure complex learning outcomes, the introductory material must be new. Asking students to interpret materials identical to those used in instruction does not ensure that the exercise will mea-Materials that are similar to those used in class but vary slightly in content or form are the most desirable. Such materials can be obtained by modifying selections from textbooks, newspapers, newsmagazines, and various reference materials pertinent to the course content.

4. Select introductory material that is brief but meaningful. Another metllOd of minimizing the influence of general reading skill on the measurement of complex learning outcomes is to keep tl1e introductOlY material as brief as possible. Digests of articles are frequently available and are good raw material for interpretive exercises. If digests are unavailable, the sun1111alY of an article or a key passage may be sufficient. In some cases, the relevant infonnation is sununarized better in a table, diagram, or picture. In striving for brief introductOlY material, be careful not to omit elements that are crucial to the interpretive skills being measured. The material also should , of course, be complete enough to be meaningful and interesting to the students.

5. Revise introductory material for clarity, conciseness, and greater interpretive value. Although some materials (e.g. , graphs) can be used without revision, most selections require adaptation for testing purposes. Tecl1nical alticles frequently contain long, detailed descriptions of events. On the other hand, news reports and digests of articles are brief but often present exaggerated reports of events to attract the reader's interest. Although such repolts provide excellent material for measuring the ability to judge me relevance of arguments, the need for assumptions, the validity of conclusions, and the like, the material must usually be modified to be used effectively.

Revision of the introductOlY material and constmction of the related test items tend to be interdependent procedures. Rewriting material often suggests questions to be used , and the constmction of test questions often necessitates revisions of the material. In revising a description of an experiment, for example, assumptions, hypotheses, or conclusions explicitly stated in the description may be deleted and used as a basis for questions. Likewise, a question calling for application of the experimental findings may require the addition of new material to the selection. Thus, the revision of the introductory material and the constmction of test items proceed in a circular fashion until a clear, concise interpretive exerdse evolves.

6. Constmct test items that require analysis and interpretation of the introductory material. There are two common enol'S in the constmction of interpretive exercises that invalidate them as a measure of complex acllievement. One is to include questions that are answered directly in the introductory material, tllat is, asking for factual infonnation explicitly stated in the selection. Such questions measure reading and recall skills. The second en'Or is to include questions that can be answered correctly without reading the introductory material, that is, requiring answers based on general infonnation. These questions measure simple knowledge outcomes.

If the interpretive exercise is to function as intended, it should include only those test items that require students to read the introductOlY material and to make the desired interpretations. In some instances, the interpretations will require students to supply knowledge beyond that presented in the exercise. In others, the interpretations will be limited to the factual information provided. The emphasis on knowledge and interpretive skill will be determined by the learning outcomes being measured. Regardless of the emphasis, however, the test items shouid be dependent on the introductory materiai while at the same time calling forth mental reactions of a higher order than those related to reading comprehension.

7. Make the number of test items roughly proportional to the length of the introductory material. It is inefficient to have students analyze a long, complex selection of material and then answer only one or two questions about it. Although it is impossible to specify the exact number of questions that should accompany a given amount of material, the items presented earlier in this chapter show a desirable balance. Other things being equal, we always favor the intelpretive exercise tlut has brief introductory material and a relatively large number of test items.

8. In constructing test items for an interpretive exercise, observe all pertinent suggestions for constmcting objective items. The fonn of test item used in tlle interpretive exercise will determine the rules for construction. If multiple-choice or true-false items are used, the suggestions for constructing these item types should be followed. When modified forms are used: suggestions for constructing each of the various types of objective items should be reviewed for their applicability in construction. Freedom from melevant clues and technical defects is as important in interpretive exerdses as it is in single, independent test items.

9. In constmcting key-type test items, make tl1e categOlies homogeneous and mutually exclusive. TIle key-type item, which is used frequently in interpretive exercises, is a modified multiple-choice fonn that uses a common set of alternatives. In this regard, it is also similar to the nutching item and so should be constructed in tlle same way, with special attention devoted to the categolies used in the key. All the categories in anyone key should be homogeneolls; that is, they all should be concerned with similar types of judgment. At the same time, there should be no overlapping of categOlies. Eadl alternative should provide a .separate categOlY so that there is a dear-cut system of dassification and each item has only one correct answer.

EXAMPLE The majority of medical researchers agree that exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke is detrimental to health. A number of cities have passed ordinances that prohibit smoking in public buildings. Despite an intensive educational campaign pointing out the dangers of secondhand smoke, many cities do not prohibit smoking in public buildings. Resolved: In the interests of national health, smoking should be prohibited in all public buildings in the United States.

*Directions:* Read each of the following statements carefully. In front of each statement mark

- Key: A if the statement supports the resolution.
	   B if the statement contradicts the resolution.
	   C if the statement is a fact.
	   D if the statement is an opinion.
	- \_\_ 1. The amount of reduction in exposure to secondhand smoke in cities with ordinances prohibiting smoking in public buildings has not been studied.

(Similar items complete the exercise.)

In this example, the key indudes two overlapping categories, one concerned with the relationship of each statement to the resolution and the other with the nature of the statement itself. This makes it impossible to have only one con'ect answer for eadl statement. Item 1, for example , would have to be marked category B because it contradicts the resolution and category C because it is a statement of fact.

The key could be improved by limiting the categories to the relevance of the statements to the resolutions, as illustrated in the following key.

 EXAMPLE

- Key: A if the statement supports the resolution.
	   B if the statement contradicts the resolution.
       C if the statement neither supports nor contradicts the resolution.

If judging both the factual nature of a statement and its relevance is important, these two eiements can be combined to form discrete categories as foiiows:

 EXAMPLE

- Key: A if it is a statement of fact that supports the resolution.
	   B if it is a statement of opinion that supports the resolution.
	   C if it is a statement of fact that contradicts the resolution.
	   D if it is a statement of opinion that contradicts the resolution.

The main drawback to combining two types of judgment in one category is the greater complexity of the key. This is especially undesirable with younger students.

In mathematics, a key-type item that has been found to be quite effident is the quantitative comparison item. The use of a fixed-response format for quantitative comparison items reduces the reading required and makes it possible for students to respond to a larger number of items in a given period of time.

 EXAMPLE 
 (This item omitted from WebBook edition)

10. In constmcting key-type test items, develop standard key categories where applicable. Despite the usefulness of the interpretive exerdse for measuring complex achievement, classroom teachers have not used it extensively, often because of the difficulty of construction. The popularity of the key-type item in interpretive exercises is probably because it uses a corruTIon set of alternatives. This makes it easier to construct than the regular multiple-choice form, which requires a different set of alternatives for each item.

**It** is often possible to simplify further the construction of key-type interpretive exercises by preparing key categories that can be reused with different content. For example, a learning outcome such as the ability to recognize assumptions might lead to the following key.

 EXAMPLE

- Key: A an assumption that is necessary to make the conclusion valid.
	   B an assumption that would invalidate the conclusion.
	   C an assumption that has no bearing on the validity of the conclusion.

This key could be used with a brief description of a situation, a conclusion based on the situation, and a list of assumptions. Both the key and the form of the item could be used repeatedly, with o nly the content varying. Although selecting new content material is still a problem, the framework of the standard key categories simplifies the process.

Standard key categories, of course, cannot be used in all areas, and their use should not be permitted to determine which learning outcomes receive emphasis. Rather, the time and effort saved by such procedures should free the teacher to explore more creative applications of the interpretive exercise in other areas. See the "Checklist" box for reviewing interpretive exercises.

#### **SUMMARY**

Complex achievement refers to those learning outcomes based on higher mental processes. Such outcomes are classified under various general headings, including understanding, reasoning, thinking, and problem solving. The attainment of goals in these areas can be measured by both objective and subjective means. The most conunonly used objective item is the interpretive exercise.

The interpretive exercise consists of a series of objective questions based on written materials, tables, charts, graphs, maps, or picmres. The questions require smdents to demonstrate the specific interpretive skill being measured. For example, students might be asked to recognize assumptions, inferences, conclusions, relationships, applications, and the like. TI1e stmcture of the inteIpfetive exercise makes it possible to obtain independent measures of each aspect of thinking and problem solving. Although it is efficient for measuring such learning outcomes, it does not measure a student's ability to integrate and use these skills in a global attack on a problem. Thus, it is limited to a diagnostic analysis of problem-solving skills.

Probably the main reason for not using the interpretive exercise is the difficulty of constl1.lction. This process involves (a) selecting appropriate introductOlY material, (b) revising the material to fit the outcomes to be measured, and (c) constl1.!cting a series of dependent test items that call fOlth the desired behavior. Although these steps are admittedly time consuming, the rewards in improved teaching-learning practices seem to justify the time and effort.

### **CHAPTER 10: MEASURING COMPLEX ACHIEVEMENT: ESSAY QU ESTIONS**

Some important learning outcomes may best be measured by the use of open-ended essay questions or other types of performance assessments. Essay questions provide the freedom of response that is needed to adequately assess the ability of students to formulate problems; organize, integrate, and evaluate ideas and infonnation; and apply knowledge and skills.

Up to this point, our main concern has been with objective test items. We noted that such items can measure a variety of learning outcomes, from simple to complex, and that the interpretive exercise is especially useful for measuring complex achievement. Despite this wide applicability of objective-item types. there remain Significant instructional outcomes for which no satisfactory objective measurements have been devised. These include such outcomes as the ability to recall, organize, and integrate ideas; the ability to express oneself in writing; and the ability to create rather than merely identify interpretations and applications of data. Such outcomes require less structuring of responses than objective test items, and it is in the measurement of these outcomes that written essays and other performance-based assessments are of greatest value.

In this chapter, we consider the most familiar fonn of performance-based assessment: the essay question. Other types of performance-based assessments (which include gathering information, making oral presentations, conducting experiments, repairing or manipulating equipment, and so on) are considered in Chapter 11. Purposeful collections of student work into portfolios, which may include a wide variety of different types of assessments (e.g., written essays and other types of performance assessments), are considered in Chapter 12. Teacher observations, peer appraisals, and self-repolts are considered in Chapter 13.

#### **FORMS AND USES OF ESSAY QUESTIONS**

We focus our discussion of the essay question on its use in the measurement of complex achievement. We recognize, however, that many teachers use essay questions to measure knowledge of facrual information. It certainly can be useful to ask students to generate, in their own words, the plot of a story, the causes of a historical event, or the steps in a scientific process, all of which may be provided by a text. Although measuring such knowledge of factual information with essay questions is useful and valid, it does not tap the full potential of essay questions.

The distinctive feature of essay questions is the freedom of response. Students are free to constmct, relate, and present ideas in their own words. Although this freedom enhances the value of essay questions as a measure of complex achievement, it introduces scoring difficulties that make essays inefficient as a measure of factual knowledge. For most plllposes, knowledge of factual information can be more efficiently measured by some type of objective item. Essay questions should be used primarily to measure those learning outcomes that are not readily measured by objective test items. The special features of essay questions can be utilized most fully when their shortcomings are offset by tlle need for SUdl measurement. Learning outcomes concerned with the abilities to conceptualize, constlUct, organize, integrate, relate, and evaluate ideas require the freedom of response and tlle originality provided by essay questions. In addition, these outcomes are of such great educational significance that the expenditure of energy in the difficult and time-consuming task of evaluating the answers can be easily justified.

Essay tests and otller performance-based assessments can also be justified on the grounds that the performances required correspond more dosely to the larger instmctional goals and objectives than discrete factual-knowledge questions. Indeed, tlle validity of measurement of complex achievement may be enhanced by the lise of essay tests and other perfolmance-based assessments. Furthermore, tests send a message of what it is impoltant to learn and be able to do. Just consider how frequently tead1ers are asked the question, "Will this be on the test?" The fOim of the assessment provides a model. Thus, it is often argued tl1at if you want students to be able to communicate in writing, then they not only need to be encouraged to write but also have to be required to do so when it counts.

As implied by the previous comments, essay assessments can be useful ways of assessing student understanding and ability to organize and apply infonnation in a content area such as history, civics, literature, science, or mathematics. In any of these or otller content areas, the essay assessment allows teachers to evaluate how well students can communicate ideas. Essay assessments are, of course, also widely used where tlle main focus on evaluating student writig without regard to any particular subject matter content. In the latter case, the emphasis is more likely to be on the form of the writing, distinguishing, for example, between nalTative essays, expoSitory essays, and persuasive essays. Essay assessments may also be used to focus teacher and student attention on the writing process itself tlu-ough tlle use of variolls prewriting activities (e.g., discussion, listing and organizing ideas, constlUcting outlines, and darification of audience) as well as the initial drafting and revision of essays.

The freedom of response provided by essay questions is not an all-or-nothing affair, but a matter of degree. At one extreme, the response is almost as restricted as that in the short-answer objective item, in which a sentence or two ma.y be all that is required. At the othe r extreme, students are given almost complete freedom in constructing their responses. The wrinen essay may be several pages in length. Where the emphasis is on the writing process itself, the essay responses may include prewriting responses such as notes, lists of ideas, and outlines as well as initial drafts and revisions. Although variations in freedom of response tend to fall along a continuum between these extremes, essay questions can be convenie ntly classified into two types: restricted-response questions and extended-response qu estions or assignments.

##### Restricted-Response Essay Questions

The restricted-response question usually limits both the content and the response. The content is usually restricted by the scope of the topic to be discussed. Limitations on the form of response are generally indicated in tl1e question.

EXAMPLES Describe two situations that demonstrate the application of the law of supply and demand. Do not use examples discussed in class.

> State the main differences between the Vietnam War and previous wars in which the United States has participated.

> Why is the barometer one of the most useful instruments for forecasting weather? Answer in a brief paragraph.

> Write the verbal instructions you would give to a friend on the telephone so thatthe friend could draw a triangle on a piece of graph paper with sides that have relative lengths of 3, 4, and 5 units.

> What is measured on an essay such as the one asking students to state the differences between the Vietnam \Var and previous wars depends on a student's previous instructional experiences. If the textbook or recent class presentations have explicitly discussed ways in which the Vietnam War was different from previous wars, tl1en the students' task is simply to demonstrate an understanding of this material and to put it in their own words. That is, the essay question is simply a measure of comprehension. If the essay question presents students witl1 their flrst opportunity to think about the Vietnam War in terms of differences from previous wars, however, then tl1e essay requires analysis and higher-level thinking.

> Another way of restricting responses in essay questions is to base the questions on specific problems. For this purpose, introductory material like that used in interpretive exercises can be presented. Sucl1 items differ from objective interpretive exercises only by the fact that essay questions are used instead of multiple-choice or true-false items.

EXAMPLE There is a broad consensus among medical scientists that smoking is damaging to the health of both smokers and those who are exposed to cigarette smoke on a regular basis. Some cities have passed laws banning smoking inside all public buildings. Some people have argued against such regulations on the grounds that smoking bans violate the freedom of choice of individual smokers.

(8) Support your pos~ion .

Because the restricted-response question is more structured than the extended-response essay considered next, it is most useful for measuring learning outcomes requiring the interpretation and application of data in a specific area. In fact, any of the learning outcomes measured by an objective interpretive exercise also can be measured by a restricted-response essay question. The difference is that the interpretive exercise requires students to select the answer, whereas the restricted-response question requires them to supply it. In some instances, the objective interpretive exercise is favored because of the ease and reliability of scoring. In other situations, the restricted-response essay question is better because of its more direct relevance to the learning outcome (e.g., the ability to formulate valid conclusions).

Although restricting srudents' responses to essay questions makes it possible to measure more specific learning outcomes, these same restrictions make them less valuable as a measure of those learning outcomes emphasizing integration, organization, and originality. Restricting the scope of the topic to be discussed and indicating the nature of the desired response limit the student's opportunity to demonstrate these behaviors. For higher-order learning outcomes, greater freedom of response is needed.

##### **Extended-Response** Essays

The extended-response question or assignment allows students to select any factual information that they think is pertinent, to organize the answer in accordance with their best judgment, and to integrate and evaluate ideas as they deem appropliate. This freedom enables them to demonstrate their ability to analyze problems, organize their ideas, describe in their own words, and/ or develop a coherent argument. If analysis, organization, integration, creative expression, and evaiuation skills are emphasized in the grading of the essays as well as in instruction, this form of assessment also makes clear the va lue that is placed on these higher-order skills. On the other hand, this same freedom that enables the demonstration of creative expression and other higher-order skills makes the extendedresponse question inefficient for measuring more specific learning outcomes and inu-oduces scoring difficulties.

EXAMPLES Imagine that you and a friend found a magic wand. Write a story about an adventure that you and your friend had with the magic wand.

> Compare developments in intemational relations in the administrations of President William Clinton and President George W. Bush. Cite examples when possible.

Evaluate the significance of the sea captain's pursuit of the white whale in Moby Dick. Describe the influence of Mendel's laws of heredity on the development of biology as a science.

Wr~e a scientific evaluation of the Copernican theory of the solar system. Include scientific observations that support your statements.

The need to measure a student's global attack on a problem can be easily defended. The thinking and problem-solving skills measured by objective interpretive exercises and restricted-response essay questions seldom function in isolation. In a natural situation, they operate together in a manner that includes more than a sum of the skills involved. These skills interact with one another and with the knowledge and understa.nding the

problem requires. Thus, it is not just the skills we are measuring but also how they function together.

Both tead1ers and test specialists agree that the extended-response question requires complex behaviors that cannot be measured by more objective means; but they often differ in their level of concern about the difficulty of scoring extended written responses in a way that can satisfactorily measure these behaviors. Test specialists point out that unless considerable attention is given to the d10ice of questions and to scoring procedures, the scoring may be too unreliable to yield defensible measurement. Nevertheless, many tead1ers continue to use the extended-response question to measure student achievement without adequate attention to the complexities involved in the construction and scoring of such questions. Neither a hard-line measurement position that rejects extended essays as an approach to measurement nor one that ignores the difficulties of scoring seems to contribute much to the valid measurement of student achievement. It seems more sensible to identify the complex skills we want to measure, formulate questions that elicit these skills, evaluate the results as reliably as we can, and then use these data as the best evidence we have available.

#### **SUMMARY COMPARISON OF LEARNING OUTCOMES MEASURED**

The restricted-response essay question can measure a variety of complex learning outcomes similar to those measured by the objective interpretive exercise. The main difference is that the interpretive exercise requires students to select the answer, and the restricted-response question requires the student to supply the answer. In comparison, extended-response essay assessments measure more general learning outcomes, such as the abilities to organize, integrate, evaluate, and express ideas. They may be used to measure wliting skills as well as the understanding and ability to apply subject-matter content knowledge. A comparison of the types of complex learning outcomes measured by each of these types of assessment is presented in Table 10.1. The learning outcomes in the table, of course, merely suggest the types of learning outcomes that may be measured. With slight modifications, an infinite variety of outcomes can be stated in each area. The freedom of response to essay questions is a matter of degree, and thus the functions of the restricted-response question and the extended-response question often overlap.

#### **ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF ESSAY QUESTIONS**

##### **Advantages**

A major advantage of the essay question is that it measures complex learning outcomes that cannot be measured by other means; but the use of essay questions does not guarantee the measurement of complex achievement. To do so, essay questions must be as carefully constructed as objective test items. The course objectives peltinent to complex achievement must be defined in terms of spedfic learning outcomes, an d the essay questions must be phrased in a way that will require students to engage in the targeted thinking skills. When a table of specifications is used in planning for the assessment, it is simply a matter of constructing the questions in accordance with the spedfications.

|                                     | â¢ summarize (e.g., writing a summary of a story)                                                          |  |  |  |  |
|                                     | â¢ construct creative stories (e.g., narrative essays)                                                     |  |  |  |  |
|                                     | â¢ explain concepts or principles (e.g., expository essay) â¢ persuade a reader (e.g., persuasive essay)    |  |  |  |  |
|                                     | (and similar outcomes based on a pupil's ability to write an essay for a given purpose)                   |  |  |  |  |

A second advantage of the extended-response essay is its emphasis on the integration and application of thinking and problem-solving skills. Although objective items such as the interpretive exercise can be designed to measure various aspects of complex achievement, the ability to integrate and apply these skills in a general attack on a problem is best measured by extended-response essay questions.

Perhaps the most obvious advantage of essay assessments is that they enable the direct evaluation of writing skills. In some instances, the evaluation of specific writing skills may be combined with the assessment of subject-matter knowledge and understandings (e.g., communication of mathematical or scientific principles, ideas, and concepts). In other cases, the assessment of writing skills may be the sole or primary purpose (e.g., skill in developing characters in a narrative story or writing mechanics).

Another commonly cited advantage of the essay question is its ease of construction. This factor has led to the widespread use of essay questions by classroom teachers. In a matter of minutes, most teachers can formulate several essay questions, an attractive feature for the busy teacher. This apparent advantage can be very misleading, however. Constructing essay questions that require the conceptual understanding and thinking skills emphasized in a particular set of learning outcomes takes considerable thought and effort. When ease of construction is stressed, it usually refers to the common practice of dashing off questions with little regard for the course objectives. In such cases, there is some question whether ease of construction can be considered an advantage. In addition to the invalidity of the measurement, evaluating the answers to carelessly developed questions tends to be confusing. Moreover, valid scoring of responses to any essay question requires great care in the development and application of scoring rubrics, and providing written comments and suggestions on student essays that can help students improve their writing is both highly desirable and time consuming.

Finally, the potentially most important advantage of the essay question is its contribution to student learning. The contribution to learning can be direct. The process of preparing a response to an extended-response essay question, for example, may also be an effective learning exercise. The effects on learning can also be indirect. The model of what students are expected to do in response to essay questions often coincide with and encourage effective learning activities. Course Smart

##### Limitations

The most commonly cited limitation of the essay question is the unreliability of the scoring. Over the years, various studies have shown that written essays are scored differently by different teachers and that even the same teachers score responses different times. The poor reliability across scorers, however, is frequently the result of failure to identify clearly the learning outcomes being measured and the failure to establish welldefined scoring rubrics.

Evaluating essays without adequate attention to the learning outcomes being measured and the scoring rubrics to be used is like "three blind men appraising an elephant." One teacher stresses factual content; one, organization of ideas; and another, writing skill. With each teacher evaluating the degree to which different learning outcomes are achieved, it is not surprising that scoring diverges. Even variations in scoring by the same teacher can probably be explained to a large extent by inadequate attention to learning outcomes and

scoring rublics. When the evaluation of answers is not guided by clearly defined outcomes and scoring rubrics, it tends to be based on less stable, intuitive judgments. Although the judgmental scoring of essay responses will always have some degree of unreliability, scoring reliability can be greatly increased by clearly defining the outcomes to be measured, properly framing the questions, carefully following scoring rules, and obtaining practice in scoring.

A closely related limitation of essay questions is the amount of time required for scoring the responses. If the scoring is done conscientiously and helpful feedback is provided to students, even a small number of papers may require several hours of scoring time. If the classes are large and several extended-response essay questions are used, conscientious scoring becomes practically impossible. Ironically, most of the suggestions for improving the scoring of responses to essay questions require more time, not less, as might be hoped. The only practical solution is to reserve the use of extended-response essay questions for those learning outcomes that cannot be measured well objectively. With fewer essay questions to score in a given test, more time will be available for evaluating the answers.

Another shortcoming of essay questions is the limited sampling of content they provide. So few questions can be included in a given test that some areas are measured thoroughly while many others are neglected. This inadequate sampling makes essay questions especially inefficient for measuring knowledge of factual information. For such outcomes, we can use objective test items and reserve essay questions, especially extended-response questions, for measuring complex achievement. This does not eliminate the sampling problem, however, because we would also like an adequate sample of complex behaviours. When we use essay questions we should try to obtain a representative a sample of learning outcomes as possible. One way of doing this is to accumulate evidence from a series of essay questions administered at different times throughout the school year. The collection of the results throughout the year into portfolios, as is described in Chapter 12, can serve other important evaluation and communication functions.

#### **SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING ESSAY QUESTIONS**

The improvement of the essay question as a measure of complex learning outcomes reqUires attention to two problems: (1) how to construct essay questions that call forth the desired student responses and (2) how to score the answers so that the acheivement is reliably measured. Here we suggest ways of COnstlUCting essay questiOns, and in the next section we suggest ways of improving scoring, although these two procedures are interrelated.

1. Restlict the use of essay questions to those learning outcomes that cannot be measured satisfactOlily by objective items. Other d1ings being equal, objective measures have the advantage of efficiency and reliability. When objective items are inadequate for measuring the learning outcomes, however, the use of essay questions can be easily defended despite d1eir limitations. Complex learning outcomes such as those pertaining

to the organization, integration, and expression of ideas wit! be neglected lmless essay questions are used. By restricting the use of essay questions to these areas, the evaluation of student achievement can be most fully realized.

2. Construct questions that will call forth the skills specified in the learning standards. Like objective items, essay questions should measure the achievement of clearly defmed content standards or instructional outcomes. If the ability to apply plinciples is being measured, for example, the questions should be phrased in such a manner that they require students to display their conceptual understanding or a panicular skill. Essay questions should never be hurriedly constructed in the hope that they will measure broad, important (but unidentified) educational goals. Each essay question should be carefully designed to reqUire students to demonstrate achievement defined in the desired learning outcomes. See the box "Types of Thought Questions and Sample Item Stems" for examples of the many types of questions that might be asked; the phrasing of any particular question will vary somewhat from one subject to another.

Constructing essay questions in accordance with particular learning outcomes is mucll easier with restricted-response questions than with extended-response questions. The restricted scope of the topic and the type of response expected make it possible to relate a restlicted-response question directly to one or more of the ou tcomes. The extreme freedom of the extended-response question makes it difficult to present questions so that the student's responses will reflect the particular learning outcomes desired. This difficulty can be partially overcome by indicating the bases on which the answer will be evaluated.

 EXAMPLE Write a two-page statement defending the importance of conserving our natural resources. (Your answer will be evaluated in terms of its organization, its comprehensiveness, and the relevance of the arguments presented.)

Informing students that they should pay special attention to organization, comprehensiveness, and relevance of arguments defines the task, makes the scoring criteria explicit, and makes it possible to key the question to a particular set of learning outcomes. These directions alone will not, of course, ensure that the appropriate behaviors will be exhibited. It is only when the students have been taught the relevant skills and how to integrate them that such directions will serve their intended purpose.

3. Phrase the question so that the student's task is clearly defined. The purpose a teacller had in mind when developing the question may not be conveyed to the student if the question contains ambiguous phrasing. Students interpret the question differently and give a hodgepodge of responses. Because it is impossible to detennine which of the incorrect or off-target responses are due to misinterpretation and which to lack of achievement, the results are worse than woIthless: They may actually be harmful if used to measure student progress toward instructional objectives.

One way to clarify tlle question is to make it as specific as possible. For the restrictedresponse question, this means rewriting it until the desired response is clearly defined.

 EXAMPLE

*Poor:* Why do birds migrate?

Better: State three hypotheses that might explain why birds migrate south in the fall. Indicate the most probable one and give reasons for your selection.

The improved version presents the students with a definite task. Although some students may not be able to give the correct answer, they all will certainly know what type of response is expected. Note also how easy it would be to relate such an item to a specific learning outcome , such as "the ability to fonn ulate and defend tenable hypotheses."

When an extended-response question is desired, some limitation of the task may be possible , but ca re must be taken not to destroy the function of the question. If the question becomes too narrow, it will be less effective as a measure of the ability to select, organize, and integrate ideas and information. The best procedure for clarifying the extended-response question seems to be to give the student explicit directions concerning the type of response desired.

 EXAMPLE

*Poor:* Compare the Democratic and Republican parties.

Better: Compare the current policies of the Democratic and Republican parties with regard to the role of government in private business. Support your statements with examples when possible. (Your answer should be confined to two pages. It will be evaluated in terms of the appropriateness of the facts and examples presented and the skill w~h which it is organized.)

The first version of the example offers no common basis for responding and, consequently, no frame of reference for evaluating the response. If students interpret the question differently, their responses will be organized differently, because organization is partly a function of the content being organized. Also, some students will narrow the problem before responding, thus giving themselves a much easier task than students who attempt to treat the broader aspects of the problem.

The improved version gives students a clearly defined task without destroying their freedom to respond in original ways. This is achieved both by specifying the scope of the

question and by including directions concerning the type of response desired. See the box "The Impoitance of Writing Skill."

4. Indicate an approximate time limit for each question. Too often, essay questions place a premium on speed because inadequate attention is paid to reasonable time limits during the test's construction. AB each question is constructed, the teacher should estimate the approximate time needed for a satisfactory response. In allotting response time, keep the slower students in mind. Most errors in allotting time needed are in giving too little time. It is better to use fewer questions and give more generous time limits than to put some students at a disadvantage.

The time limits allotted to each question should be indicated to the students so that they can pace their responses to each question and not be caught at the end of the testing time with "just one more question to go." If the assessment contains both objective and essay questions, the students should, of course, be told approximately how much time to spend on each part of the test. This may be done orally or included on the test form itself. In either case, care must be taken not to create overconcern about time. The adequacy of the time limits might velY well be emphasized in the introductolY remarks so as to allay any anxiety that might arise.

5. Avoid the use of optional questions. A fairly common practice when using essay questions is to give students more questions than they are expected to perform and then permit them to select a given number. For example, the teacher may include six essay questions in a test and direct the students to respond to any three of them. This practice is generally favored by students because they can select those questions they know most about. Except for the desirable effect on student morale, however, there is little to recommend the use of optional questions. If students answer different questiOns, it is obvious that they are taking different tests, and so the common basis for evaluating their achievement is lost. Each student is demonstrating the acllievement of different learning outcomes. As noted earlier, even the ability to organize cannot be measured adequately

##### TheImportance of Writing Ski ll

Performance on an essay test depends largely on wliting ability. If students are to be able to demonstrate the achievement of higher-level learning outcomes, then they must be taught the thinking and writing skilis needed to express themselves. This means teaching them how to select relevant ideas, compare and relate ideas, organize ideas, apply ideas, infer, analyze, evaluate, and write a well-constructed response that includes these elements. ABking students to "compare," "interpret," or "apply" has little meaning unless they have been

taught how to do these things. This calls for direct teaclling and practice in writing, in an atmosphere that is less stressful than an examination peliod. Use of analytic scoling critetia that give separate scores for characteIistics SUcll as the quality of ideas, use of examples, use of supporting evidence, and mechanics of wtiting such as grammar, punctuation, and spelling can inlprove scotIDg and, if communicated to students, can both guide their effOitS in const1llcting essays and lead to improvements of specific writing skills.

without a common set of responses because organization is partly a function of the content being organized.

another way. When students anticipate the use of optional questions, they can prepare responses on several topics in advance, commit them to memory, and then select questions to which the responses are most appropriate. During such advance preparation, it is also possible for them to get help in selecting and organizing their response. Needless to say, this provides a distorted measure of the student's achievement, and it also tends to have an undesirable influence on study habits, as intensive preparation in a relatively few areas is encouraged.

Of course, there are learning outcomes that involve in-deptl1 study of topiCS that are shaped and defined by students. Evaluation of student work on topics of their own choosing is important for such learning outcomes. The assessment of such outcomes, however, is better approached through the assignment of projects than by an essay test. See the "Checklist" box to evaluate essay questions you constmct.

#### **SCORING CRITERIA**

Clear specification of scoring criteria in advance of administering essay questions can contribute to improved reli.1.bility and validity of the assessment. Planning how responses will be scored will frequently lead to rethinking and clarification of the questions so that students have a clearer idea of what is expected. Informing students of the scoring criteria that will be used in evaluating their responses also can enhance the validity of the assessments because students are more likely to focus their efforts in the direction intended by the teacher.

After the assessment has been administered, it is often useful to do an initial review of the responses to a single question. Based on the initial review, a few exemplar or "anchor" responses may be identified that most dearly correspond to the levels of the scoring rubric. The comparability and fairness of scores assigned to student responses can be enhanced by comparing each response to the selected anchor responses.

It is impOltant that scores or levels identified in a scoring rubric be descriptive and not merely judgmental in nature. It is better, for example, to define a level of the rubric as ''wIiting is clear and thoughts are complete" than to only characterize the level as "excellent." Reliability, comparability, and fairness of scores are enhanced by clear descriptions.

##### Scoring Rubrics for Restricted-Response Essay Questions

In many instances, scoring guides for restricted-response essay questions are most readily constructed starting with the teacher wIiting an example of an expected response. If the student is asked to describe three factors that contributed to the start of the Civil War, for example, the teadler might construct a list of acceptable reasons and simply give the student 1 point for each of up to three reasons given from the list. In the example given earlier where students are asked to write a paragraph explaining why a barometer is one of the most useful instruments in forecasting weather, the teacher might list key ideas that would need to be there for the student to get full credit as well as the level of explanation that would be awarded paltial credit.

##### Anaiytic Scoring Rubrics for Extended-Response Essays

AnalytiC scoring rubrics enable a teacher to focus on one characteristic of a response at a time. The separation of characteristics such as writing mechanics from the quality of the content of the essay can be especially useful. Separate scores for characteristics such as these provide the student with clearer feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of the response.

AnalytiC scores for writing *skills* may consist of just two broad categoIies such as rhetorical effectiveness and conventions or content quality and mechanics. Sometimes finer distinctions are useful. The scoring rubrics used by the state of Oregon for its statewide writing assessment consists of the following seven analytic dimensions.

- 1. Ideas and Content
- 2. Organization 
- 3. Voice
- 4. Word Choice
- 5. Sentence Fluency
- 6. Conventions
- 7. Citing Sources

Scaling rubrics for 6-point ratings are available on-line at the Oregon Department of Education Web site at http://www.ode.state.or.us/ teadllearn!testingiscOlingiguides/ 2006- 07/asmtwIiscorguide0607eng.pdf. The analytic scoring rubrics are presented for the seven dimensions or "traits. " The specification of a score of 6 on the Organization dimension is

shown in the box showing a sample scoring rubric. Si.milar descriptions are given for score points of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for this and the other six dimensions.

These lists, together with the actual descriptions of mbrics, may provide a useful starting point for constructing analytic scoring dimensions for use in the classroom. For any such list, dedsions would need to be made about the number of score points to use and the criteria for determining the score level on each dimension. Scoring mbrics such as the one available on-line from the Oregon Department of Education illustrate ways in which the individual score points can be described.

Another example illustrating descriptions of score points on analytic dimensions is shown in Table 10.2. The examples in the table were adapted from work by Gearhalt, Herman, Baker, and Whittaker (1994). Six scale points on four analytic scales and an overall general impression dimension are described. Scoring mbrics such as these are useful in scoring expository essays or descriptive summaries. Variations may be useful for other types of essays. For example , in scoring a persuasive essay, adclitional dimensions for rating the use of supporting evidence, distinguishing between fact and opinion, and determining the coherence of the argument may be desirable for giving students feedback on how to make their argument more effective.

##### Holistic Scoring: Rubri cs for Extended-Response Essavs U I <sup>I</sup>

As the name suggests, holistic scoring rublics yield a single overall score taking into account the entire response. Holistic scoring rubrics can generally be constructed more rapidly, and they generally can be used to score a set of essay responses more rapidly than analytic scoring rubrics. These advantages must be weighed against the major disadvantage that they do not provide students with feedback on spedfic aspects of the response that are strong and ones where improvement is needed. Of course, such feedback can be provided by marginal notes and comments that the teacher writes on the student's paper, but holistic scores alone provide less specific guidance to the student than analytic scores.

 Example of the Oregon Department of Education Scoring Rubric to Be Considered a 1/6" on the Organization Dimension

"The organization enhances the central idea(s) and its development. The order and structure are compelling and move the reader through the text easily. The writing is characterized by

- 1. Effective, pethaps creative, sequendng and paragraph breaks: the organizational structure fits the topic, and the writing is easy to follow.
- 2. A strong, inviting beginning that draws the reader in and a strong, satisfying sense of resolution or dosure.
- 3. Smooth, effective transitions among all elements (sentences, paragraphs, ideas).
- 4. Details that fit where placed."

Narrative essay mbrics for five analytic dimensions were developed by Gearhart,Herman, Baker, Whittaker (1994) and used by primary classroom teachers in several studies (see Wolf & Gearhart, 1997). The five dimensions are as follows:

- 1. Theme, including considerations of degree to which it is explicit or implicit and the degree to whidl it is didactic or revealing
- 2. Character, including the degree to which the characters are flat and static or "round" and dynamic
- 3. Setting, including the degree to which the setting is simple or multmmctional and the degree to which it is merely part of the backdrop or essential to the story
- 4. Plot, induding the degree to whidl the plot is simple or complex and the degree to which it is static or presents conflict
- 5. Communication, including the degree to which the story is context based or reader considerate and the degree to which it is literal or symbolic

For each of these dimensions, descriptions of six levels of performance are described (see Wolf & Gearhart, 1997; or see the home page for the Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing [CRESSll at http://www.cse.ucla.edu).

It is also the case that the ease of construction of a set of labels (e.g., excellent, good, adequate, promising but has major shortcomings, weak, and inadequate) is no real advance of the traditional A, B, C, D, and F marks and provides little if any real guidance to the teacher in scoring or to the student in understanding what is expected. Such labels alone fall short of what is meant by a scoring rubric.

A holistic scoring rubric, like an analytic scoring rubric, needs to have the scores or labels elaborated by statements of the characteristics of the response that deserve the score of "excellent" or "promising but has major shortcomings." The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) writing assessment uses a 6-point holistic scoring rubric, shown in Table 10.3.

A sample CRESST scoring rubric for use in making holistic ratings of the quality of explanations is shown in Table 10.4.

| 2     | ' Undeveloped response to the task in which students began to respond, but did so in a very abbreviated, confusing, or disjointed manner.         |  |

| 4     | Developed: "a response to the task that contained the necessary elements, but may have been unevenly developed or un elaborated.                  |  |
| 5     | Elaborated: "a well developed and detailed response that may have gone beyond the essential elements of the task.                                 |  |
| 6     | Extensively elaborated: a response that shows "a high degree of control over the various elements of writing. Compared with papers given a rating |  |
|       | of '5,' those rated '6' may have been similar in content, but they were better organized, more clearly written, and less flawed:'                 |  |

#### **SUGGESTIONS FOR SCORING ESSAY QUESTIONS**

Improving the reliability of scoring answers to essay questions begins long before the questions are administered. The first step is to decide what learning outcomes are to be measured. This is followed by phrasing the questions and the scoring rubIics in accordance with the learning outcomes and including explicit directions concerning the type of answers desired. Only when both the students and the teacher understand the task to be performed can reliable scoring be expected. No degree of proficiency in evaluating answers can compensate for poorly designed and phrased questions.

When the necessary preliminalY steps have been taken in constructing essay questions, the following suggestions can be used effectively to ina'ease the reliability of the scoring.

1. Prepare an outline of tbe expected answer in advance. This should contain the major points to be included, the characteristics of the answer (e.g., organization) to be evaluated, and the amount of credit to be allotted to each. For a restricted-response question calling for three hypotheses, for example, a list of acceptable hypotheses would be prepared, and a given number of scoring points would be assigned to each. For an e:x.1.endedresponse question, the major points or aspects of the answer would be outlined. In addition, the relative amount of credit to be allowed for such characteristics as accuracy of the factual information, peltinence of examples, skill of organization, and effectiveness of presentation would be indicated.

Preparing a scoring rubric provides a common basis for evaluating the students' answers and ina'eases the Likelihood that our standards for each question will remain stable throughout the scoring. If prepared during the test's construction, such a scoring key also helps us phrase questions that clearly convey the types of answers expected. For a restricted-response essay question, a point might be assigned to each of two or three desired properties of the responses, and a point would be awarded to a student response for each of the desired propel1ies it contained. For an extended-response essay question, a 5-point rating might be used. Five points would be awarded to a response that was well organized and clear and that displayed the type of analysis and reasoning sought by the question. Three points might be awarded for an answer that was clear and adequate but not very compelling. Answers that contained little accurate information and displayed inadequate reasoning might be awarded a single point.

2. Use the scoring rubric tbat is most appropriate. As discussed previously, two types of scoring mblics, analytic and holistic, are commonly used with essay questions. Analytic rubrics focus attention on one characteristic at a time and are especially useful in providinging students with specific feedback abollt aspects of their work. Holistic rubrics are likely to be more useful when the focus of the assessment is on overall content understanding than wliting skill per se.

3. Decide how to handle factors that are irrelevant to the learning outcomes being measured. Several factors influence our evaluations of answers that are not directly pertinent to the purposes of the measurement. Prominent among these are legibility of handwriting, spelling, sentence structure, punctuation, and neatness. We should make an effort to keep such factors from influencing ollr judgment when evaluating the content of the answers. In some instances, such factors may, of course, be evaluated for their own sake. When this is done , you should obtain a separate score for written expression or for each of the specific factors. As far as pOSSible, however, we should nor let such factors contaminate the e:x.'tent to which our scores reflect the achievement of other learning outcomes.

Another decision concerns the presence of irrelevant and inaccurate factual iformation in the response. Should YOll ignore it and score only that which is pertinent and conect? If you do, some students will write evelything that occurs to them, knowing that you will SOlt it out and give them credit for anything correct. This discourages careful thinking and desirable evaluative abilities. On the other hand, if you reduce scores for irrelevant and inaccurate material, the question of how much to lower the score on a given paper is a troublesome one. Probably the best procedure is to decide in advance approximately how much the score on each question is to be lowered when the inclusion of irrelevant matelial is excessive. The students should then be warned that such a penalty will be imposed.

4. Evaluate all responses to one question before going on to the next one. One factor that contributes to unreliable scoring of essay questions is a shifting of standards from one paper to the next. A paper with average answers may appear to be of mucl1 higher quality when it follows a failing paper than when it follows a near-perfect one. One way to minimize this is to score all answers to the first question, reorder the papers to be evaluated, then score all answers to the second question and so on until all the questions have been scored. A more uniform standard can be maintained with this procedure because it is easier to remember the basis for judging each answer and because answers of various degrees of quality can be more easily compared. When the rating method is used and the responses are placed in several piles on the basis of each answer, shifting standards also can be c11ecked by evaluating each answer a second time and reclassifying it if necessary.

Evaluating all answers to one question at a time helps counteract another type of en"Or that creeps into the scoring of essay questions. When we evaluate all the answers of a single student, the first few answers create a general impression of the student's achievement that colors our judgment of the remaining answers. Thus, if the first answers are of high quality, we tend to overrate the following answers; if they are of low quality, we tend to undemue them. This "halo effect" is less likely when the answers for a given student are not evaluated in continuous sequence.

5. When pOSSible, evaluate the answers without looking at the student's name. The general impression we form about each student during our teaching is also a source of bias in evaluating essay questions. It is not uncommon for a teacher to give a high score to a poorly written answer by rationalizing that "the student is really capable, even though she didn't express it clearly. " A similar response by a student regarded less favorably will receive a much lower score, with the honest conviction that the student deserved the lower score. This halo effect is one of the most serious deterrents to reliable scoring by classroom teachers and is especially difficult to counteract. See the box "Bluffing: A Special Scoring Problem" for information about a scoring problem unique to essay questions.

When pOSSible, the identity of the students should be concealed until all answers are scored. The simplest way to do this is to have the students put their names on the back of the papers. If a student's identity cannot be concealed because of familiar handwriting, the best we can do is make a conscious effort to eliminate any such bias from our judgment.

6. If especially important decisions are to be based on the results, obtain two or more independent ratings. Sometimes essay questions are included in assessments used to select students for awards, scholarships, special training, and the like. In such cases, two or more competent persons should score the responses independently, and their ratings should be compared. After any large descrepancies have been satisfactorily arbitrated (possibly by a third scorer), tl1e independent ratings may be averaged for more reliable results.

#### SUMMARY

The essay question is especially useful for measuring those aspects of complex achievement that cannot be measured well by more objective means. These include (a) the ability to supply rather ilian merely identify interpretations and applications of data , and (b)

##### Bluffing: A Special Scoring Problem

It is possible for students to obtain higher scores on essay question responses than they deserve by means of clever bluffing. This is usually a combination of writing skill, general knowledge, and common "tricks of the trade. " Following are some ways that students might attempt to influence the reader and, thus, inflate their grades.

- **1.** Writing something for evelY question, even if it is only a restatement of the question (Students figure they might get some credit. Blank spaces get none.)
- 2. Stressing the importance of the topic covered by the question, especially when short on facts (e.g. , "This battle played a significant role in the Civil War. ")
- 3. Agreeing with the teacher's views whenever it seems appropriate (e.g. , "The future of mankind depends on how well we conserve our natural resources. ")
- 4. Being a name-dropper (e.g. , "This is supported by the well-known

experiment by Smith." The reader assumes that the student knows Smith's "well-known" expeliment.)

- 5. Writing on a related topic and fitting it to the question (e.g., Prepared to write on President Harry Truman but asked to write about General Douglas MacArthur, the student might start with, "Hany Truman was the president who fired General MacArthur." From then on, there is more about President Truman than General MacArthur.)
- 6. Writing in general terms that can fit many situations (e.g., In evaluating a short story, the student might say: "This was an interesting StOIy. The dlaracters were fairly well developed, but in some instances more detail would be welcome." This might be called the fonune-tellef approach.)

Although bluffing cannot be completely eradicated, carefully phrasing the questions and following dearly defined scoring procedures can reduce it.

the ability to organize, integrate, and express ideas in a general attack on a problem. Outcomes of the first type are measured by restricted-response questions and outcomes of the second type by extended-response questions.

Although essay questions provide an effective means of measuring Significant learning outcomes, they have celtain limitations: (a) Scoring tends to be unreliable, (b) scoring is time consuming, and (c) only a limited sampling of achievement is obtained. Because of these shortcomings, essay questions, especially ones requiring extended responses, should be limited to assessing those outcomes that cannot be measured well by objective items.

The construction and scoring of essay questions are interrelated processes that require attention if a valid and reliable measure of achievement is to be obtained. Questions should be phrased so that they measure the attainment of definite learning outcomes and clearly convey to the students the type of response expected . To the extent pOSSible, sCOling criteria should be spedfied in advance. For restricted-response essay questions, scoring rubrics can usually be generated by outlining possible answers deserving full

credit and indicating what aspects of the answers are required for different amounts of paltial credit. For extended-response essays, a choice between analytic and holistic scoring rubrics should be made. Analytic scoring rubrics have the advantage of providing students with more specific feedback than holistic scoring rubrics. Holistic scoring rubrics can be developed and applied more rapidly and may correspond closely to grading dedsions that need to be made. Available examples of both analytic and holistic scoring rubrics provide useful starting points for developing rublics for classroom use.

Indicating an approximate time limit for each question and avoiding the use of optional questions also contribute to more valid results. Scoring procedures can be improved by (a) using a scoring rubric, (b) adapting the scoring method to the type of question used, (c) controlling the influence of irrelevant factors, (d) evaluating all answers to each question at one time, (e) evaluating without looking at the students' names, and (f) obtaining two or more independent ratings when important dedsions are to be made.

### **CHAPTER 11: MEASURING COMPLEX ACHIEVEMENT: PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENTS**

E ssay tests are the most common example of a performance-based assessment, but there are many others, including altistic productions, experiments in SCience , oral presentations, and the use of mathematics to solve real-world problems. The emphasis is on dOing, not merely knowing--on process as well as product.

Essay tests are an example of one type of performance assessment, but there are many asoects of writinQ that are not taooed within the constraints of the normal essav test. .1 u .L.1 <sup>J</sup> Choosing a topic, identifying an audience, gathering information, prepaIing drafts, seeking critiques, and revising are all impOltant aspects of writing that are not measured by the usual essay test. Moreover, writing is not the only type of performance outcome we need to assess. Many highly valued learning outcomes emphasize the actual performance of tasks in realistic settings. This is obvious in the case of alt or music and for vocational or industrial education courses, such as auto repair, woodworking, or word processing. It is also true for mathematics, sdence, social studies, and foreign languages. In ead1 case, performance-based assessments are needed to measure some of the desired learning outcomes.

For example, although knowledge of vocabulary and grammar in a foreign language can be measured with the various forms of paper-and-pencil tests, speaking skills cannot. Oral pelformance is required to assess a student's spoken communication skills in a foreign language. Similarly, the assessment of a student's ability to make observations, formulate hypotheses, coiiect data, and draw vaiid scientific conclusions may require the use of performance assessments. The use of mathematics to solve meaningful real-world problems and to communicate solutions to others may also be best assessed by the lise of perfonnance tasks in realistic settings.

Performance assessments provide a basis for teachers to evaluate both the effectiveness of the process or procedure used (e.g., approach to data collection or manipulation of instruments) and the product resulting from performance of a task (e.g., completed report of results or completed artwork). Unlike simple tests of factual knowledge, there is unlikely to be a single right or best answer. Rather, there may be multiple performances and problem solutions that would be judged to be excellent. Problem formulation, the organization of ideas, the integration of multiple types of evidence, and originality are all important aspects of performance that may not be adequately assessed by paper-and-pencil tests.

#### TYPES OF PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENT

Performance assessments are also sometimes referred to as "authentic assessments" or "alternative assessments," but the terms are not interchangeable. "Alternative assessment" highlights the contrast to traditional paper-and-pencil tests, whereas "authentic assessment" emphasizes the practical application of the tasks in real-world settings. We prefer the label "performance assessment" because it is more descriptive than "alternative assessment" and less pretentious than "authentic assessment."

Authenticity is a matter of degree. A highly authentic assessment of communication skills in German, for example, might involve listening to the verbal interactions of a student when visiting Germany; but such an assessment obviously would lack practicality for the teacher of a typical German class. Simulated spoken interactions between the teacher and a student or among students, although not quite as authentic, are much more practical. In either case, the focus of the assessment is on the student's performance in communicating in German.

Although authenticity is usually only approximated, it is an important goal of performance assessment. Providing realistic contexts can make problems more engaging for students and help the teacher evaluate whether a student who can solve a problem in one context can solve it in another. Hence, it is desirable to increase the authenticity of tasks to whatever extent possible.

Like essay questions, performance assessments should be used primarily to measure those learning outcomes that cannot be measured well by objective test items. Objective test items are generally more efficient and more reliable for measuring factual knowledge and the ability to solve well-structured problems (e.g., solve a quadratic equation). Performance assessments are better suited for applications with less-structured problems where problem identification; collection, organization, and evaluation of information; and originality are emphasized (e.g., where is the best place to locate a restaurant?). They are also essential for learning outcomes that involve the creation of a product (e.g., a typed letter or a painting) or an oral or physical performance (e.g., the presentation of a speech, the repair of an engine, or the use of a scientific instrument).

Hands-on performance tasks that require students to manipulate objects, measure outcomes, and observe results of experimental manipulations are sometimes essential to capture the full array of skills needed to perform "authentic" tasks. This is obvious in the case of a driving test or a performance test for a dentist, but it may also be true in science and other areas. Research has shown that computer simulations of tasks in science sometimes may be good substitutes for actual hands-on performance of the task, but in other instances even high-fidelity simulations may have relatively poor relationships for hands-on performance. Poor relationships between simulations and actual hands-on performance occur most commonly when the manipulation of apparatus (e.g., mixing a compound or taking a measurement) is an integral part of the task.

Performance tasks can valY substantially in the degree to which perfonnance is restricted. A word-processing test, for example, might be completely constrained with regard to format and content of a letter to be typed. The task of creating a sculpture might be almost completely unconstrained with regard to the approach a student might take or the nature of the product produced. Most performance tasks fall in between these extremes.

##### Restricted-Response Performance Tasks

A restricted-response performance task is usually relatively narrow in definition. The instructions are generally more focused than extended-response performance tasks, and the limitations on the types of performance expected are likely to be indicated.

Restricted-response peIformance tasks sometimes start with a simple multiple-choice or sholt-answer question, SUd1 as the one in Figure 11.1. Those questions are then extended by asking for an explanation of the answer and sometimes an explanation for why the other answers were not selected. Often, different answers in the first palt of the task could be given full credit if the explanation provided sound reasoning to defend the choice.

 EXAMPLES 
 - Type a letter of application for a job.
 - Read aloud a section of a story.
 - Use various combinations of five straight pieces of plastic to construct as many different triangles as you can and record the perimeters of each
 - Determine which of two liquids contains sugar and explain what results support your conclusion.
 - Construct graphs of the average amount of rainfall per month for two cities
 - Request aloud directions to the train station in French.
 - Write the names of the countries in the appropriate areas of a blank map of Europe.
 - Sara knows that half the students in her class were invited to Kim's birthday party. Also, half were invited to Julie's party. Sara thinks that these figures add up to 100%, so she thinks she will surely be invited to one of the parties. Explain why Sara is wrong. If possible use a diagram in your explanation:

If the explanation paIts of the task in Figure 11.1 were omitted, there would be no way to determine the basis for a student's choice of one of the three figures. Even if students selected the preferred d10ice (B), you would not know whether they did so for a sound reason or whether they simply guessed. Nor would you know whether they were attentive to the fact that graph C is impossible because it depicts 44 students when there were only 20 students in Mr. Pang's class.

As is true of many tasks that are called performance assessment tasks, the example in Figure 11.1 is, of course, a type of essay question. No real manipulation or hands-on activity is involved. A task such as the one in the figure might readily be adapted to a classroom assessment activity that involved data collection and graphing. Children, for example, might each be asked to count the number of pockets in the clothes they were wearing. Those numbers could be reported, and each student could construct a graph. Separate graphs for boys and for girls in the classroom might also be constructed. They might then be asked to write a description of the graph they constructed before being presented with a task like that in Figure 11.1.

A variety of tasks may be used to assess the skills young students have at making and recording observations, summarizing the observations, and reaching conclusions. In one such task, students were instructed in how to find and count their pulse. They were then asked to count the number of pulses in each of four segments of 15 seconds where the teacher looked at a stopwatch and gave instructions to start and stop. After recording the four initial segments, students were told to jump up and down for 1 minute. After exercise, children were asked to count and record their pulse for four additional 15-second periods. Next, a second period of jumping for 2 minutes was required, followed by four more recordings of 15-second segments. Students were asked to construct a table and a graph reporting the results and describe what the results showed when the initial four recordings were compared to those following the first and second rounds of exercise. Finally, they were asked to explain what they observed.

The relative advantages and disadvantages of restricted performance tasks parallel those of restricted essay questions. They are generally more structured and require less time to administer than extended-response performance tasks. The shorter administration time makes it possible to administer more tasks and thereby gain broader coverage of the content domain. The greater degree of structure makes the task easier to score. On the other hand, the structure makes the tasks less valuable for measuring student skills, such as approaches to ill-structured problems, integration of information, and originality. Extended performance tasks are better suited for such outcomes.

##### Extended Performance Tasks

The extended performance task may require students to seek information from a variety of sources beyond those provided by the task itself. For example, students may need to use the library, make observations, collect and analyze data in an experiment, conduct a survey, or use a computer or other types of equipment. They may have to identify which aspects of the task are most relevant. The process or procedures that they use may be observed and be an important part of the assessment. The product that is produced may take a variety of forms, such as the construction of graphs or tables, the use of photographs or drawings, or the construction of physical models. Products may be developed over the course of several days and include opportunities for revision or modification. This freedom enables students to demonstrate their ability to select, organize, integrate, and evaluate information and ideas. The price of these gains includes the loss of efficiency, possible loss of breadth of coverage of the content domain, and greater difficulty in rating performance.

 EXAMPLES
 - Prepare and deliver a speech to persuade people to take actions to protect the environment.
 - Hog is a game played with dice. The goal is to get the largest possible score. You may roll any number of dice out of a large cup. If none of the numbers is a 1, then the score for the roll is the sum of the numbers rolled. If a 1 is obtained on any of the dice, the score for the roll is zero. What number of dice do you think it best to roll? Defend your decision (Mathematical Sciences Education Board, 1993).
 - Write a computer program in BASIC that will sort a list of words alphabetically.
 - Design and carry out an investigation to estimate the acceleration, a, of a falling object such as a baseball. Describe the procedure used, present the data collected and analyzed, and state your conclusions.
 - Read an abridged version of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Imagine that you were living then and heard the debates. Write a letter to a friend explaining the historical issues addressed and their importance in terms of what you know about the problems facing the nation at the time of the debates (Baker, Aschbacher, Niemi, & Sato, 1992).


Perfomance assessments require students to demonstrate skills by actually performing. They involve doing rather than just lmowing about, and there are sometimes important differences between the two. For example, a guitar player may know which frets to press the stIings against for a particular chord without being able to perform the task smoothly to produce the desired sound. Similarly, a computer programmer may know the function of various needed commands without being able to produce a correctly working program  to perform a specific task, or a science student may know the parts and functions of an instrument without being able to use it properly to obtain the information needed to solve a problem. Performance assessments are needed to observe and evaluate such skills. they also communicate the message that actual pelformance is important.

A perfomance assessment task used in the 1996 NAEP Science Assessment at grade 4 is shown in Figure 11.2. As can be seen, this task requires students to do simple manipulations, to measure and record the outcomes of placing the pencil and thumbtack in the different bottles of water, to draw conclusions about the "mystery water," and to make predictions about the effects of adding salt to a solution. In this example, the manipulations, observations, and measurements are relatively simple , but these basic skills are cIitical in many settings and are not well assessed in a purely paper-and-pendl assessment.

The effective use of pelfonnance assessments requires careful attention to task selection and to the ways perfonnances will be scored. Care needs to be taken in the identification of the complex skills we want to measure, in the construction of tasks that will require students to demonstrate those skills, and in the evaluation of the resulting process and/or product. Without careful attention to these aspects of the assessment, it is unlikely that the effort will yield adequately reliable or valid measures of the complex skills that are being sought.

As the name suggests, performance assessments measure the ability of students to perform tasks that cOlrespond to important instructional objectives. Restricted perfollnance tasks generally focus on specific skills (e.g., reading a passage alOUd). Extended perfonnance tasks are more likely to involve problem solving and the integration of a variety of skills and understandings. A compaIison of the types of complex learning outcomes measured by each of these types of performance tasks is presented in Table 11.1.

#### **ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS**

##### Advantages

A major advantage of performance assessments is that they can clearly communicate instructional goals that involve complex performances in natural settings in and o utside of school. By using tasks that require performances that correspond as closely as is feasible to major instructional objectives, they provide instructiona l targets and Table 11.1

| Extended-response performance task   | Ability to                                                                    |
|                                      | â¢ build a model                                                               |
|                                      | â¢ collect, analyze, and evaluate data                                         |

thereby can encourage the development of complex understandings and skills. Often, performance assessment tasks are indistinguishable from good instmctionaI activities.

A second advantage of perfonnance assessments is that they can measure complex learning outcomes that cannot be measured by other means. As has already been stated, knowing how to do something is not the same as being able to do it, much less do it well. Thus, a paper-and-pencil test that measures what a student knows about effective public speaking, for example, does not provide a measure of the student's ability to deliver an effective speech.

A third advantage of performance assessments is that they provide a means of assessing process or procedure as well as the product that results from performing a task. For example , by observing students while they are conducting a laboratolY experiment, strengths and weaknesses in the use of equipment and in teclmique can be assessed, as can success in completing the experiment and the strength of reasoning provided to support conclusions.

A f0U11h advantage of performance assessments is that they implement approaches that are suggested by modern learning theory. Rather than viewing students as recipients of discrete bits of knowledge, modem learning theory conceives of students as active participants in the construction of meaning. According to this view, new infonnation must be actively transformed and integrated with a student's prior knowledge. High-quality perfOlmance-based assessments take student background knowledge into account and engage students in the active construction of meaning.

##### **Limitations**

The most commonly cited limitations of petformance assessments parallel those cited for essay questions. Unreliability of ratings of performances across teachers or across time for the same teacher is clearly a limitation. Careful attention to the learning outcomes that the task is intended to assess and to the scoring rubrics that will be used in rating the performances is required both at the time tasks are developed and at the time pe1formances are rated to minimize this limitation. Although the judgmental scoring of complex performances will always include some uncontrollable variations, the scoring reliability, the comparability of scores assigned to the performances of different students, and hence the fairness of the assessment can be greatly increased by clearly defining the outcomes to be measured, properly framing the tasks, and carefully defining and following rubrics for scoring performances.

Another limitation of extended performance assessments is their time-consuming nature. Because a substantial amount of time may be required to allow students to have an adequate opportunity to perfonn eacll task, relatively few extended perfonnance assessments can be obtained within a reasonable amount of time. There is considerable evidence that pelfolU1ance on one task provides only a relatively weak basis for generalizing to petformances on other tasks intended to assess common or related learning outcomes. Thus, solid generalization to a larger domain of outcomes requires the use of multiple tasks. Overcoming the limitation of weak generalization of petformance across tasks requires the accumulation of information from petformances on different tasks during the course of the year. Justification for the devotion of the required amount of instructional time to the assessments reqUires that the tasks provide students with good learning oppommities as well as assessment results.

#### **SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING PERFORMANCE TASKS**

The development of high-quality pelfonnance assessments that effectively measure complex learning outcomes requires attention to task development and to the ways in which petformances are scored. We begin with a consideration of ways to improve the development of tasks and then suggest ways to improve scoring.

1. Focus on learning outcomes that require complex cognitive skills and student performances. It is important that tasks be interesting, but that is not sufficient. Tasks need to be developed or selected in light of important learning outcomes. Because performancebased tasks generally require a substantial investment of student time, they should be used primarily to assess learning outcomes that are not adequately measured by less timeconsuming approaches.

2. Select or develop tasks that represent both the content and the skills that are central to important learning outcomes. CUITent conceptions of learning stress the interdependence of content and skills. Problem solving in one subject-matter area is not the same as it is in another area. Debating a political issue in social studies is different than debating the effectiveness of a piece of literature. In each case, the content and process are interdependent.

Thus, it is important to specify the range of content and resources students can use in perfanning a task. Past class assignments provide one natural basis for specifying content, but for many tasks it will be desirable to allow students the opportunity to do additional research to expand their knowledge base. In any event, the specification of assumed content understandings is clitical to ensuring that a task functions as intended.

3. iinimize the dependence of task performance on skills that are irrelevant to the intended purpose of the assessment task. The key here is to focus on the intention of the assessment. Although both the ability to read complicated texts and the ability to communicate clearly are important learning outcomes, they are not necessarily the intent of a particular assessment. Reading ability, for example, might be irrelevant for an assessment that is intended to measure a student's ability to use mathematics to solve a practical problem (e.g., determine how much and what type of lumber to buy to build a clubhouse with specified features). However, if the task is presented in a way that requires substantial reading, then this factor may add to task difficulty for some students but not for others and thereby reduce the validity of the intended interpretation of the results. This irrelevant source of difficulty would also undermine the fairness of the assessment especially for students with learning disabilities or who are learning English as a second language. On the other hand, writing skills might be an intended part of a mathematics task where a goal of the assessment was to measure a student's ability to communicate mathematical reasoning and results.

4. Provide the necessary scaffolding for students to be able to lmderstand the task and what is expected. Challenging tasks often involve ambiguities and require students to experiment, gather information, formulate hypotheses, and evaluate their own progress in solving a probelm however problems can not be solved in vaccum. Students need to have the prior knowledge and skills required to address the problem. TI1ese prerequisites can be a natural outcome of prior instruction or may be built in to the task. Preassessment activities, for example, can be used not only to introduce a task but also to ensure that students have the prior knowledge essential for the task and are familiar with the materials or equipment that they need to use. It is important to ask: What prior knowledge and skills are assumed in order to perfonn the task?

5. Construct task directions so that the student's task is clearly indicated. Vague directions can lead to such a diverse array of perfonnances that it becomes impossible to rate them in a fair or reliable fashion. By deSign, many performance-based tasks give students a substantial degree of freedom to explore, approach problems in different ways, and develop novel solutions. Such intended task characteristics, however, are not an excuse for vague directions. In the task shown in Figure 11.3, students need to experiment and decide on the placement of objects into categories on their own. They also have to construct an explanation for the classification they provide, but the task of using the magnet to test the items, the classification of objects into two categories, and the need to explain the difference between the objects in the two categories are made explicit.

6. Clearly communicate performance expectations in terms of the scoring rubrics by which the performances will be judged. Specifying the critelia to be llsed in rating performance helps clarify task expectations for a student. Explaining the criteria that will be used in rating performances not only provides students with guidance on how to foclls their effOltS but also helps convey priorities for learning outcomes.

 Magnet
 Task Descriptor
 To use a magnet to identify magnetic and nonmagnetic items and then to explain the difference between them.

 EquipmentJMaterial
 A magnet and the following seven objects: plastic button, iron or steel washer, steel paper clip, iron nail, glass marble, plastic rod, and copper coin.

 Student Instructions
 Test the objects with the magnet and divide them into two groups. List the objects in the two groups and explain what makes the objects in the two groups different.

 Scoring Scheme
 Credit was given for grouping the objects correctly. Four categories of explanations were recorded: namely, that one group was made of iron or steel, that one group was attracted by the magnet, that one group was made of iron and steel and was attracted by the magnet, and any other explanation.

Listing attributes such as appropriate symbol use, accuracy of information and scale, and ease with w hich the map can be read makes the rating criteria explicit. It also highlights the learning outcomes that are considered imponant for the task in the following example.

EXAMPLE Construct a weather map. Your map will be evaluated for accuracy of information and scale, for appropriate use of symbols, and for the ease with which it can be read.

#### **PERFORMANCE CRITERIA**

Richard Stiggins (1987) has persuasively argued that the specification of perfonnance criteria is the most importa.nt aspect of developing effective perfonnance assessments. He suggests imagining the feedback that would be provided to a student who performed poorly before the task is administered. His rationale for focusing on the criteria to be used is straightforward: "If you do not have a clear sense of the key dimensions of sound performance-a vision of poor and outstanding performance- you can neither teach students to perform nor evaluate their perfonnance."

The criteria to be used in judging student perfonnance are critical for reliable, fair, and valid assessment, and the specification of the criteria should begin at the time the tasks are being selected or developed. Both the teacher and the student need to understand the criteria that will be used to judge performance. As was just noted , criteria help clarify the task expectations for students, and they conununicate learning goals and standards. In addition, they guide the judgment process in ways that enhance reliability, fair treatment of each performance, and the validity of conclusions about each student's achievement.

The two main ways of gUiding judgments of both the process used in performing a task and any product resulting from that performance are scoring rubrics/rating scales and checklists. We begin with scoring rubrics and rating scales and then turn to a consideration of checklists.

#### **SCORING RUBRICS AND RATING SCALES**

*As* was discussed in Chapter 10, a scoring rubric is a set of guidelines fOf the application of performance criteria to the responses and performance of students. A scoring rubric typically consists of verbal deSCriptions of perfofmance or aspects of student responses that distinguish between advanced, proficient, partially proficient, and beginning levels of perfonnance. Both analytic (Table 10.2) and holistic (Tables 10.3 and 10.4) scoring rubrics were illustrated in Chapter 10.

The analytic scoring rubric requires the identification of different dimensions or characteristics of performance that are rated separately. For example, a ma.thematics task might be rated in terms of the accuracy of the calculations and the clarity of the explanation. A written report on the results of a sdence experiment might be rated on factual accuracy, quality of analysis, and the degree to which conclusions were justified. A literalY criticism might be rated fOf organization, quality of ideas, clarity of expression, and mechanics. An oral presentation might be rated both for d1e substantive quality of the report and for the effectiveness of the presentation.

A holistic rubric provides deso'iptions of different levels of overall performance. Holistic rubrics are effident and correspond more direcdy to global judgments required in the aSSignment of grades, but they do not provide students with specific feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of their pelformance as is provided by analytic rubrics.

Rating scales are often limited to making quality judgments (e.g., excellent, good, fair, or poor) or scaled frequency judgments (e.g., always, frequently, sometimes, or never) for each leve1. As is illustrated in some of the following examples, however, tl1e distinction between scoring rubrics and rating scales is often blurred by adding the descriptions of a rubric to me judgmental qualities of a rating scale.

As is illustrated in Figure 11.4, a scoring rubric may include a rating scale (excellent, good, and so on) but may also provide descriptions of characteristics or performance corresponding to ead1 point on the scale. A scoring mbric makes explicit tl1e criteria that are used to rate perfonnance. Generic scoring rubrics are available mat can be readily adapted for use in rating perfonnance on a variety of tasks. Generic scoring rubriCS, such as the one shown in Figure 11.4, provide a useful statting place for many assessments. The distinctions between me levels can be made more specific by considering the specific task and likely features that would distinguish between exemplalY performance and competent performance or between satisfactory performance witl1 minor flaws and perfonnance that has serious flaws. For example, lists of minor and major flaws might be constructed for a specific task. In a similar fashion, common misconceptions mat are anticipated in response to a particular task might be listed.

The number of levels and the verbal desctiptions used to guide the scoring may vary from simation to simation. For tl1e hands-on science task involving tl1e floating pencil

 Quality of Explanation

- 6 = t:xceiieni expianaiion (compieie, dear, unambiguous)
- 5 = Good explanation (reasonably clear and complete)
- 4 = Acceptable explanation (problem completed but may contain minor flaws in explanation)
- 3 = Needs improvement (on the right track but may contain serious flaws; demonstrates only partial understanding)
- 2 = Incorrect or inadequate explanation (shows lack of understanding of problem)
- 1 = Incorrect without attempt at explanation

 Separate Ratings of Answer and Explanation

 *Answer*

- 4 = Correct
- 3 = Almost correct or partially correct
- 2 = Incorrect but reasonable attempt
- <sup>1</sup>= Incorrect with no relationship to the problem **I\. tl.1 \_** \_\_\_\_ \_ \_\_ \_
- U = 1'110 answer

 *Explanation*

- 4 = Complete, clear, logical
- 3 = Essentially correct but incomplete or not entirely clear
- 2 = Vague or unclear but with redeeming features
- 1 = Irrelevant, incorrect, or no explanation

 Examples of generalized scoring rubrics for mathematics problems

shown in Figure 11.2, for example, the separate scoring rubrics were used for each part of the response. For the part of the task where the student was supposed to identify the mystery water and explain how they could "tell what the mystery water is," student responses were scored using a rubric with three levels:

*Complete:* Student stated that "the mystery water was fresh water and gave a satisfactOly explanation that referred to observations made doing the hands-on task" (O'Sullivan, Reese, & Mazzeo, 1997, p. 44).

*Partial:* Student stated that the water was fresh but did not support the choice with direct reference to observations from the hands-on task.

*Incorrect:* Student gave the wrong answer or gave contradictory explanation for the choice of the correct answer of fresh water.

 - o points: Student does not respond appropriately.

Task and scoring guide adapted rrom part or a Utah State Office or Education set or assessment tasks called Weathercaster's Helper for first-grade students (Regional Educational Laboratories, 1998).

Scoring mbrics for hands-on tasks may include multiple dimensions, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the process of canying out the task. For example, in an elementalY school sdence task used by Shavelson, Baxter, and Pine (1991) and Shavelson, Baxter, and Gao (1993), students were asked to determine which of several paper towels absorbed the most water. The scoring mbric records the method used to get the towel wet, the saturation of each towel, the procedure used to measure the amount of water absorbed, the care in measurement, and the accuracy of the result.

Rating scales provide a flexible way of converting infomlation about one or more characteristics of a performance(eg overall quality, adequacy of measurement and of results). Typically, a rating scale consists of a set of characteristics or qualities to be judged and some type of scale for indicating the degree to which each attribute is present. The rating fonn itself is merely a reponing device. Its value in appraising the learning and development of students depends largely on the care with which it is prepared and the appropriateness with which it is used. As with other assessment inst11.lments, it should be constructed in accordance with the learning outcomes to be assessed, and its use should be confined to those areas in which there is a sufficient oppommity to make the necessalY observations. If these two principles are properly applied, a rating scale will serve several important assessment fimctions: (a) It will direct observation toward specific aspects of perfolmance, (b) it will provide a common frame of reference for rating the pelfonnance of all students on the same set of charactetistics, and (c) it will provide a convenient method for recording the observer's judgments.

##### **Types of Rating Scales**

Rating scales may take many forms, but most of them belong to one of the types described next. Each type is illustrated by using two dimensions from a scale for rating contributions to class discussion.

Numerical Rating Scale. One of the simplest types of rating scales is that in which the rater checks or circles a number to indicate the degree to which a cllaracteristic is present. Typically, each of a series of numbers is given a verbal descliption that remains constant from one characteristic to another. In some cases, it is merely indicated that the largest number is high, one is low, and the other numbers represent intennediate values.

The numerical rating scale is useful when the characteristics or qualities to be rated can be classified into a limited number of categories and there is general agreement concerning the categOlY represented by each number. As commonly used, however, the numbers are only vaguely defined, so the interpretation and use of the scaJe valy.

EXAMPLE Directions: Indicate the degree to which this student contributes to a group problem-solving task by circling the appropriate number. The numbers represent the following values: 4-consistently appropriate and effective; 3-generally appropriate and effective; 2-needs improvement, may wander from topic and 1-unsatisfactory (disruptive or off topic)

- 1. To what extent does the student participate in group discussions?
	          1    2    3    4
- 2. To what extent are the comments related to the topic under discussion?
	          1    2    3    4

Graphic Rating Scale. The distinguishing feature of the graphic rating scale is tha t each characteristic is followed by a horizontal line. The rating is made by placing a check on the line. A set of categories identifies specific positions along the line, but the rater is free to check between these points.

 EXAMPLE

Directions: Indicate the degree to which this student contributes to a group problem-solving task by placing an X anywhere along the horizontal line under each item.

1. To what extent does the student participate in group discussion?

![](_page_282_Figure_15.jpeg)

The scale shown in this example uses the same set of categories for each dlaracteristic and is commonly referred to as a constant-alternatives scale. When these categories Vaty from one characteristic to another, the scale is called, quite logically, a changing-alternatives scale.

Although the line in the graphic rating scale makes it possible to rate at intermediate points, using single words to identify the categOlies has no great advantage over the use of numbers. There is little agreement among raters concerning the meaning of such terms as *seldom, occasionally,* and *frequently.* What is needed are descriptions of perfomlances that indicate more specifically how students behave who possess various degrees of the characteristic being rated.

Descriptive Graphic Rating Scale. The descriptive graphic rating scale uses descriptive phrases to identify the points on a graphic scale. The descriptions are thumbnail sketdles of how students behave at different steps along the scale . In some scales, only the center and end positions are defined. In others, a descriptive phrase is placed beneath each point. A space for comments is also frequently provided to enable the rater to clarify the rating.

- EXAMPLE Directions: Make your ratings on each of the following characteristics by placing an X anywhere along the horizontal line under each item. In the space for comments, include anything that helps clarify your rating.
	- 1. To what extent does the student participate in group discussions?

| i I        | i I       | i I        |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Never         | Participates | Participates  |
| participates; | as much as   | more than any |
| quiet,        | other group  | other group   |
| passive       | members      | member        |
| Comment:      |              |               |

2. To what extent are the comments related to the topic under discussion?

| I                    |           I                      |                    I                  |
| Comments ramble,     | I Comments usually pertinent,    | Comments are always related to topic        |
| distracts from topic | occasionally wanders from topic  |                                       |      

The descriptive graphic rating scale is generally the most satisfactory for school use. It explains to bOtil the teacher and the student the types of performance that represent different degrees of progress toward desired learning outcomes. In well-written rubrics, tile top level of desaiption actually is the desired learning outcome or at least conununicates what good work is intended to look like. The more specific performan ce descriptions also

contribute to greater objectivity and accuracy during the rating process. To aid scoring, numbers also may be added to each position on the scale.

##### Uses of Rating Scales

Rating scales can be used to assess a wide variety of learning outcomes and aspects of development. As a matter of convenience, these uses may be classified into two assessment areas: (1) process or procedure, and (2) product.

Process or Procedure Assessment. In many areas, achievement is expressed specifically through the student's performance. Examples include the ability to give a speech, manipulate laboratory equipment, work effectively in a group, sing, play a musical instrument, and perform various physical feats. Such activities do not result in a product that can be assessed, and short-answer or fixed-response tests are generally inadequate. Consequently, the process or procedures used in the performance itself must be observed and judged.

Rating scales are especially useful in assessing process or procedures because they focus on the same aspects of performance in all students and have a common scale on which to record our judgments. If the rating form has been prepared in terms of specific learning outcomes, it also serves as an excellent teaching device. The dimensions and behavior descriptions used in the scale show the student the type of performance desired.

Two items from a typical rating scale for assessing a speech are presented in Figure 11.5. The first part of the form is devoted to the content of the speech and how well it is organized. The second part is concerned with aspects of delivery, such as gestures, posture, appearance, eye contact, voice, and enunciation. In developing such a scale, a teacher must, of course, include those characteristics that are most appropriate for the type of speaking ability to be assessed and for the age level of the student to be judged.

Product Assessment. When student performance results in some type of product, it is frequently more desirable to judge the product than the process or procedures. The ability to write a theme, for example, is best assessed by judging the quality of the theme itself. Little is to be learned by observing the student's performance. In some areas, resm however, such as word processing, conducting work in the laboratory, and woodworking, it might be most desirable to rate procedures during the early phase of learning and products later, after the basic skills have been mastered. In any event, product rating can provide assessment information in many areas. In addition to those already mentioned, it is useful in assessing such things as handwriting, drawings, maps, graphs, notebooks, term papers, book reports, results of laboratory experiments, and objects made in vocational courses.

A rating scale serves somewhat the same purpose in product assessment than it does in process assessment. It helps us judge the products of all students in terms of the same characteristics, and it emphasizes to the students those qualities desired in a superior product.

##### *Common Errors in Rating
Certain types of errors occur so often in ratings that special efforts are needed to counteract them. These include (a) personal bias, (b) halo effect, and (c) logical errors.

Personal bias errors occur when there is a general tendency to rate all individuals at approximately the same position on the scale. Some raters tend to use the high end of the scale only, which is referred to as the generosity error. Occurring less frequently (but persistently for some raters) is the severity error, in which the lower end of the scale is favored. A third type of constant response is shown by the rater who avoids both extremes of the scale and tends to rate everyone as average. This is called the central tendency error.

It also occurs much less often than the generosity error, but it tends to be a fixed-response style for some raters.

The tendency of a rater to favor a celtain position on the scale has two undesirable results. First, it puts in doubt a single rating of an individual. A high or low rating might reflect the personal outlook of the rater rather than the actual performance or personal characteristics of the person rated. Second, favoring a celtain position on the scale limits the range of any individual's ratings. Therefore, even if we make allowances for a teacher's general tendency to rate students high, tile ratings for different students may be so close together that they fail to provide reliable discriminations.

The halo effect is an error that occurs when a rater's general impression of a person influences the rating of individual characteristics. If the rater has a favorable attitude toward the person being rated, then there will be a tendency to give high ratings on all traits; but if the rater's attitude is unfavorable, the ratings will be low. This differs from the generosity and severity errors, in which the rater tends to rate everyone high or everyone low.

Because tile halo effect causes a student to receive similar ratings on all characteristics, it tends to obscure strengtl1S and weaknesses on different traits. This obviously limits the value of the ratings.

Teachers need to guard against the possibility tiut tileir ratings might be distorted because of preconceptions based on inappropriate factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, and social background. Halo effects leading to lowered ratings of all performances of some students as the result of such preconceptions are of particular concern. Concealing the identity of tile student where feasible when rating products of performance is one good safeguard against halo effects. Awareness of our own personal preferences and prejudices is also impOltant.

A logical error results when two characteristics are rated as more alike or less alike than they actually are because of the rater's beliefs concerning their relationship. In rating achievement, for example, teachers tend to overrate the achievement of students identified by aptitude tests as gifted because they expect achievement and giftedness to go together. Similarly, teachers who hold the common but false belief that gifted students have poor social adjustment will tend to underrate tllem on social characteristics. These errors result not from biases toward certain students or certain positions on the rating scale but from the rater's assumption of a more direct relationship among traits than actually exists.

The vatious types of errors that appear in ratings are rather disconcerting to the classroom teacher who must depend on rating scales for assessing certain aspects of learning and development. Fortunately, however, the errors can be markedly reduced by proper design and use.

##### **Principles of Effective Rating**

The improvement of ratings requires careful attention to selection of the characteristics to be rated, design of the rating form, and conditions under which the ratings are obtained. The following principles summarize the most impoltant considerations in these areas. Because the descriptive graphic rating scale is the most generally useful form for

school purposes, the principles are directed toward the constmction and use of this type of rating scale.

1. Characteristics should be educationally significant. Rating scales, like other assessment instlUments, must be in harmony with the school's objectives and desired learning outcomes. Thus, when constJUcting or selecting a rating scale, the best guide for determining what charactetistics are most significant is the list of intended learning outcomes. When these have been clearly stated in performance terms, it is often simply a matter of selecting those that can be most effectively assessed by ratings and then modifying the statements to fit the rating format (see the "Guidelines" box).

![](_page_287_Picture_3.jpeg)

##### Preparing Rating Scales

The same basic principle guiding the constlUction of test items should be followed in preparing rating scales. That is, the instlUment should be designed to measure the student performance described in the instlUctional objectives. Let us assume, for example, that a science teacher has listed the following outcomes as evidence of skill in one phase of laboratOlY performance.

Demonstrates Effective Use of Laboratory Equipment

- 1. Selects proper equipment for a given experinlent.
- 2. Sets up equipment quickly and correctly.
- 3. Manipulates eqUipment as needed during the experiment.
- 4. Measures accurately witll each measuring device. 
- 5. Follows safety rules when using equipements
- 6. Cleans and returns equipment to its proper place.
- 7. InteIprets the results of the experiment appropriately.
- 8. Integrates results with other knowledge in drawing conclusions.

This list of intended outcomes can then serve as the basis for preparing a rating scale to assess skill in using laboratory eqUipment. Each item in the list becomes an item in tl1e rating form by simply adding some basis for recording degrees of effectiveness, as follows:

 Selecting Laboratory EqUipment

![](_page_287_Figure_18.jpeg)

The same procedure is followed when rating an educational product (e.g., ti1eme, graph, painting, or shop and home economics projects). The charaaeristics of a good product are listed, and tllese then become the items in ilie rating scale. The instlUment itself is simply a convenient form for recording observations and judgments concerning tl1e extent to which students are meeting ti1e criteria specified in tlle objectives.

2. Identify the learning outcomes that the task is intended to assess. The intent of the assessment is critical for determining those characteristics of performance that should determine the ratings. Clear identification of the learning outcomes helps establish priorities for rating, distinguish levels of performance in terms of learning outcomes, and reduce dependence on factors that are irrelevant to the intent of the assessment. When there are multiple learning outcomes associated with the task, separate ratings corresponding to each outcome may be desirable and can enhance the value of the formative feedback that is provided to students.

Course Smart

3. Characteristics should be directly observable. There are two considerations involved in direct observation. First, the characteristics should be limited to those that occur in school situations so the teacher has an opportunity to observe them. Second, they should be characteristics that are clearly visible to an observer. Overt behaviors, such as participation in classroom discussion, clear enunciation, and use of facts to support an argument, can be readily observed and reliably rated. However, less tangible types of behavior, such as interest in history, attitude toward literature, and amount of effort expended in library research, tend to be unreliably rated because their presence must be inferred from outward signs that are indefinite, variable, and easily faked. When Compossible, we should confine our ratings to those characteristics that can be observed and judged directly.

4. Characteristics and points on the scale should be clearly defined. Many rating errors arise from the use of vague characterizations and inadequate identification of the scale points. The brief descriptions used with the descriptive graphic rating scale help overcome this weakness. They explain both the points on the scale and each characteristic being rated. When it is infeasible or inconvenient to use a descriptive scale, as on the back of a school report card, a separate sheet of instructions can be used to provide the desired descriptions.

5. Select the type of scoring rubric that is most appropriate for the task and the purpose of the assessment. With a holistic rubric, each performance is given a single rating or score, usually on a scale with 4 to 6 points, based on an overall judgment of the quality of the performance in comparison to the criteria specified in the scoring rubric. Holistic rubrics are efficient and translate easily into grades. As already noted, however, analytic scoring rubrics have more diagnostic value because they focus attention on those aspects of performance where improvement is needed. For analytic scores to be of diagnostic value, the characteristics or dimensions being rated must be sufficiently distinct to allow each to be reliably rated and not simply be redundant reflections of the same global impression of the performance.

6. Between three and seven rating positions should be provided. The exact number of points to be designated on a particular scale is determined largely by the judgments to be made. In areas permitting only crude judgments, fewer scale positions are needed. There is usually no advantage in going beyond the 7-point scale. Only rarely can we make finer discriminations than this, and we can provide for those few situations by allowing the rater to mark between points.

7. Rate performances of all students on one task before going on to the next one. The advantages of rating all performances on one task before starting another task parallel those described for scoring all answers to an essay question before going on to the next question. It is easier to keep the scoring a-iteria clearly in mind and to apply them more uniformly when considering only a single task at a time than it is when going from task to l:.:1.sk for each SUI dent. It also reduces the likelihood that judgments of performance on one task will be contaminated by judgments of a student's performance on a preceding task. When responses of a single student to several tasks are considered one after another, there is a strong tendency for the performance on early tasks to create an expectation for performance on later tasks. Those expectations can result in more lenient or more stringent ratings of performance than would otherwise be given.

By rating one task at a time for all sUldents before going to the next task, it is also possible to change the order in which student performances are rated. Thus, a student is not rated first or last on all tasks or right after another student who has exceptionally good performance or exceptionally bad performance on all tasks.

8. When possible, rate performances without knowledge of the student's name. This suggestion is the same as the one given for scoring answers to essay questions. Obviously, it is not possible for all types of performance (e.g., an oral presentation), but it is good practice when possible. It is a practice that enhances the fairness of ratings because it reduces the chances that ratings will be influenced by a halo effect rather than only by the actual pelfonnance of a student.

9. When results from a performance assessment are likely to have long-term consequences for students, ratings from several observers should be combined. The pooled ratings of several teachers will generally yield a more reliable description of sUI dent performance than that obtained from anyone teacher. In averaging ratings, the personal biases of individual raters tend to cancel out one another, but there is still a need to be aiert for biases that may be shared due to simiiariry of background and experiences of teachers doing the rating.

#### **CHECKLISTS**

A checklist is similar in appearance and use to the rating scale. The basic difference between them is in the type of judgment needed. On a rating scale, one can indicate the degree to which a characteristic is present or the frequency with which a behavior occurs. The checklist, on the other hand, calls for a simple yes-no judgment. It is basically a method of recording whether a characteristic is present or absent or whether an action was or was not taken. Obviously, a d1ecklist should not be used when degree or frequency of occurrence is an important aspect of the appraisal.

The d1eckHst is espedally useful at the primalY level, where much of the classroom assessment depends on observation rather than testing. A simple checklist for assessing the mastelY of mathematics skills at tl1e beginning primary level is shown in Figure 11.6. If the intended learning outcomes are stated as specifically as this for ead11earning area , a d1ecklist can be prepared by simply adding a place to check yes or no. As with the rating scales, the stated learning outcomes specify the performance to be assessed, and the checklist is merely a convenient means of recording judgments.

Checklists are also useful in assessing those performance skills that can be divided into a series of specific actions. An example of such a checklist for the proper application

of varnish is shown in Figure 11.7. The performance has been subdivided into a series of observable steps, and the observer simply checks whether each step was satisfactorily compieted. The checkiist in Figure 11.7 inciudes mostly those actions tllat are desired in a good performance. In some cases, it may be useful to add those actions that represent common errors so that they can be checked if they occur. In Figure 11.7, for example we might add after Item 4, "Does 1I0t stir varnish before using." Because stirring paint is a necessalY step when painting, some students might incorrectly carryover this action when using varnish. If me checklist is to be used by students, the incorrect actions should, of course, be clearly identified as such.

The following steps summarize tlle development of a checklist for assessing a procedure consisting of a series of sequential steps.

- 1. Identify each of tlle specific actions desired in the performance.
- 2. Add to the list those actions that represent common errors (if they are useful in the assessment, are limited in number, and can be clearly stated).
- 3. Arrange the desired actions (and likely errors, if used) in the approximate order ill which they ate expected to OcCur.
- 4. Provide a simple procedure for dlecking each action as it occurs (or for numbering the actions in sequence, if appropriate).

In addition to its use in assessment of process, the dleckiist can also be L1sed to assess products. For this purpose, the form usually contains a list of characteristics that the finished product should possess. In assessing the product, the teacher simply checks whether each characteristic is present or absent. Before using a checklist for product assessment, you should decide whether the quality of the product can be adequately deso'ibed by merely noting the presence or absence of each dlaracteristic. If quality is

more predseiy indicated by noting the degree to which each characteristic is present, a rating scale should be used instead of a checklist.

In the area of personal- social development, the checklist can be a convenient method of recording evidence of growth toward specific learning outcomes. Typically, the form lists the behaviors that have been identified as representative of the outcomes to be assessed. In the area of work habits, for example, a primalY teacher might list the following behaviors (to be marked yes or no):

- Follows directions
- Seeks help when needed
- Works cooperatively with others
- Waits turn in using materials
- Shares materials with others
- Tries new activities
- COll1pietes stalled tasks
- Returns equipment to proper place
- Cleans work space

Although such items can be used in checklist form if only a crude appraisal is desired, they can also be used in rating scale form by recording the frequency of occurrence (e.g., always, sometimes, never).

Although we have described the individual use of d1ecklists, rating scales, and anecdotal records (see Chapter 13), they are often used in combination when assessing student performance (see Table 11.2).

#### **STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN RATING**

In this chapter, we have limited our discussion to rating scales and checklists used by the teacher. We purposely omitted those checklists and rating scales used as self-report techniques by students because these will be considered in the following chapter. Before closing our discussion here, however, we should point out that most of the devices used for recording the teacher's observations also can be used by students to judge their own progress. From an instnlctional standpoint, it is often useful to have students rate themselves (or their products) and then compare the ratings with those of the teacher. If this comparison is made during an individual conference, the teacher can explore with ead1 student the reasons for the ratings and discuss any marked discrepancies between the two sets.

Self-rating by a student and a follow-up conference with the teacher can have many benefits. It should help the student Ca) understand better the instructional objectives, Cb) recognize the progress being made toward th e o bjectives, Cc) diagnose more effectively particular strengths and weaknesses, and Cd) develop increased skill in self-assessment. Of spedal value to the tead1er is the additional insight gained.

Student participation need not be limited to the use of the assessment instnlments. It is also useful to have students help develop the instnlments. Through class discussion, for example, they can help identify the qualities desired in a good speech or a well-written

repOlt. A list of these suggestions can then be used as a basis for constructing a rating scale or d1ecklist. Involving students in the development of assessment devices has special instructional values. First, it directs learning by causing the students to think more carefully about the qualities to strive for in a performance or product. Second, it has a motivating effect because students tend to put fOlth most effort when working toward goals they have helped deftne.

#### **SUMMARY**

Performance tasks provide a means of assessing a variety of student skills that cannot be measured by objective tests. To name just a few of the possibilities in addition to written responses, the perfonnances may include oral communication; the construction of models, graphs, diagrams, or maps; or the use of tools and equipment (computers, or scientific or musical instruments). Unlike objective items, both the process and the product resulting from the perfonnance can be assessed. Because they are time consuming both for students to do and for teachers to rate, the emphasis on perfonnance assessment should be on measuring complex ad1ievement that cannot be measured well by objective tests.

Restricted-response tasks are more structured and require less time to administer than extended-response tasks. These features facilitate reliability and wider coverage of a content domain. Extended-response tasks are best suited to the measurement of more complex learning outcomes, sllch as gathering, organizing, synthesizing, evaluating, and pfesenting iflfOffriatiOfl.

Extended performance tasks underscore the importance attached to effective performance and provide an effective means of measuring significant learning outcomes. They are the only feasible approach for measuring some important learning outcomes, they allow for the assessment of process as well as product, and their emphasis on the engagement of students in the active construction of meaning is consistent with modern learning theOly. Their limitations are due mainly to the unreliability of judgmental ratings and to the time-consuming nature of the tasks and rating. Careful attention to rating criteria is critical for minimizing the unreliability due to scoring. Because of the lin1ited generalizability of pelfonnance across tasks designed to measure the same or similar learning outcomes, it is important to base decisions on evidence accumulated from several tasks.

Rating methods are a systematic procedure for obtaining and recording the observers' judgments. Of the several types of rating scales available, the desoÂ·iptive graphiC scale seems to be the best for scl1001 use. In rating procedures, products, and various aspects of personal-sodal development, certain types of errors commonly occur. These include personal bias, halo effect, and logical errors. The control of such errors is a major consideration in constructing and using rating scales. Effective ratings result when we (a) select educationally Significant characteristics, (b) identify the learning outcomes that the task is intended to assess, (c) limit ratings to directly observable bel1avior, (d) define clearly the characteristics and the points on the scale, (e) select the most appropliate rating procedure, CO limit the number of points on the scale, (g) rate performances of all students on one task before going on to the next ones, (h) rate performances without knowledge of the student's name when possible, and (i) combine ratings from several raters when results may have long-term consequences for students.

Checklists pelform somewhat the same functions as rating scales. They are used in assessing both process and products where assessment is limited to a simple present-absent judgment.

Having students help construct and use rating devices has special values from the standpoint of learning and aids in the development of self-assessment skills.

### CHAPTER 12: PORTFOLIOS

Oystematic collections of student work into portfolios can serve a variety of instructional and assessment purposes. The value of portfolios depends heavily on clarity of purpose, the guidelines for inclusion of materials, and the criteria to be used in evaluating portfolios.

Portfolios of work have been used as the basis for assessment with increasing frequency in the past 20 years. They have been defined and used by individual classroom teachers for use in their day to-day instruction and assessment of student progress. They have also been used as the basis for determining grades and for reporting student achievement and progress to parents. Portfolios of work may span more than a single school year and provide information to teachers about student achievement as students move from one grade to the next. Sometimes portfolios have been adopted as an approach to assessment by entire schools. In some instances, such as the case of Central Park East Secondary School described later in this chapter, they have become a primary basis for satisfying requirements for graduation from high school. They have sometimes been used by high school graduates as part of their applications to college or submitted to employers when applying for jobs. There are even examples of district- and statewide adoptions of portfolios as a means of assessment for purposes of school or system accountability.

Although the focus in this chapter is on portfolios of student work, it is worth noting that portfolios of work have also been used in college admissions, student evaluation in higher education, job employment, and the evaluation of teaching. The National Board of Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), for example, bases its decisions about the certification of accomplished teachers primarily on portfolios of work that teachers applying for NBPTS certification prepare during a school year. Those portfolios contain videotapes showing a teacher interacting with students in the classroom, examples of problems assigned to students, samples of student work in response to those assignments, and teacher commentary on the portfolio entries.

CourseSmart

At an earlier career stage, teachers in some states are now required to submit pOltfolios that include videotapes of their teaching and other examples of their work as teachers as part of their initial certification. Some highly regarded teacher preparation programs have made substantial use of portfolios of teaching in their preservice teacher preparation and evaluation of student teachers. Because of the widespread interest in portfolios as a means of assessing teaching performance, a number of states have joined together in a project called the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and SUPPOlt Consoltium (INTASC) to develop a common, portfolio-based teacher assessment system. Like the NBPTS assessment system for accomplished teachers, the INTASC portfolios include videotapes of teaching, examples of student work, teacher feedback on that work, and teacher cornmentalY and reflections on their teaching.

The INTASC and NBPTS portfolios are more elaborate and expensive to construct and to score than portfolios of student work that a teacher would have students construct. The stakes associated with the decisions that are based on the portfolio assessments are also quite different for the teacher cenification examples than for a third-grade teacher, for example, who uses student portfolios of writing to plan instruction and provide helpful feedback to students on their work. When compared to the latter use of a pOltfolio of student work, however, the teacher certification examples illustrate that portfolios come in many different forms, including electronic or digital and may be used for many different purposes. In a summary of testing for employment, credentialing, and higher education, Sackett, Schmitt, Ellingson, and Kabin (2001) point out that ethnic differences are reduced when using portfolios and other more realistic assessments instead of traditional tests. Presumably, the reduced gap between ethnic group is due to the ability of portfolios to refelect more than cognitive abilities and  skills, such as effort or persistence.

#### **WHAT QUALIFIES AS A PORTFOLIO OF STUDENT WORK?**

It has long been cornmon to collect student work in folders. A student portfolio is also a collection of pieces of student work, but it differs from a folder of work in several irnpOltant ways. A portfolio is a collection of student work selected to serve a particular purpose, such as the documentation of student growth. Unlike some folders of work, a portfolio does not contain all the work a student does. Instead, a portfolio may contain examples of "best" works or examples from each of several categories of work (e.g., a book review, a letter to a friend, a creative short StOlY, and a persuasive essay). Pieces of work for a portfolio must be selected with care to serve the intended pl\l'poses of the portfolio.

A student portfolio is a **purposeful collection** of pieces of student work. Portfolios are sometimes described as portraits of a person's accomplishments. Using this metaphor, a student pOltfolio is usually a self-portrait, but one that often has benefited from gUidance and feedback from a teacher and sometimes from other students. With the fleXibility of student portfolios, teaching, learning, and assessment are often enmeshed in a single activity. Although the use of portfolios can be time consuming and require substantial effort on the part of students and teachers, the benefits to instruction and learning as well as assessment can make it worth the time and energy.

#### **POTENTIAL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF PORTFOLIOS**

Portfolios are believed to have a number of potential strengths (see the box "Potential Strengths of Portfolios"). The ease with which portfolios can be integrated with instmction has made them particularly appealing to teachers. Portfolios also foster student skills in evaluating their own work. Self-evaluation is a critical skill in developing independent learning ability and one that is often emphasized and reinforced by asking students to include some form of self-evaluation and thoughtful reflection on each entry in their portfolios.

Communicating with parents about student progress is an important and challenging goal for any teadler. Thoughtfully selected collections of student work in portfolios can provide parents with concrete examples of what students are accomplishing. They can also provide the focus for discussion among teachers, students, and parents. Sometimes students are asked to take the lead in conferences with parents, and using the pOltfolio to shape the discussion can have positive effects for both parents and students. Moreover, three-way conferences involving teachers, students, and parents with students taking the lead in explaining their portfolios to parents can give teachers an unusual opportunity to see how students and parents interact about the work.

Realizing these potential strengths and others listed in the box depends heavily on the effolt that goes into clarifying the purposes to be served by portfolios. It depends on the quality of the guidelines for determining what should be induded in portfolios and the criteria for evaluating them. Of course, achieving these valued results also depends on the actual uses that are made of pOltfolios.

Although the potential strengths of portfolios make them attractive both as aids in instmction and as assessment devices, portfolios also have wealmesses. They can be quite

time consuming to assemble. The investment of student time in constructing portfolios may be well spent, but teachers need to guard against any tendency for the portfolio demands to foster busywork that contributes neither to student learning nor to better assessment.

Portfolios are time consuming for teachers as well as students. Although students can benefit from the process of constructing a portfolio, they need to have constructive feedback from teachers on the work included in their pOltfolios and on the portfolios as a whole. They also need guidance about how best to construct a portfolio for a specific purpose and audience. Considerable thought, preparation, and expetience is needed to ensure that the benefits of pOltfolios justify this investment in time by both students and teachers.

Another potential weakness of portfolios arises when they are used as the basis for summative evaluation, such as the aSSignment of course grades, the celtification of achievement, or in school, district, or state accountability systems. For several reasons, ratings of portfolios tend to have relatively low reliability. Part of the poor reliability comes from the difficulty of establishing clear scoring critetia for the large and often diverse sets of materials that may be included. Poor reliability is also due, in part, to a lack of standardization that leads to limited comparability of portfolio entries that different students choose to include. Unfortunately, attempts to deal with these two problems by formulas that convelt ratings of individual entries into an overall poltfolio rating and by increased standardization and rigid rules for what students mList include in their portfolios may undermine the validity and utility of pOltfolios for their intended purposes.

Perhaps the biggest obstacle to realizing the potential value of effective poltfolio use is not a weakness per se but the naive perception that pOltfolios can be easily a-eated. Because teacl1efs and su.ldents are accustomed to keeping work in folders or files, it seems but a simple step to call the folder a portfolio. Unorganized collections of workd in folder will not accomplish the goals implicit in the strengths listed in the box. Nonetheless, considerable evidence from surveys, interviews, and teachers' observations shows that far too frequently so-called portfolios are indistinguishable from unorganized collections of work in folders with inadequate specifications of purposes, guidelines for construction, or evaluation ctitetia.

careful planning is required to capitalize on the potential strengths of portfolios and minimize their wealmesses. In addition, teachers need to be prepared to commit the time and effort required for implementing the plan and using the results. There are a number of steps in defining, implementing, and using poltfolios. The box "Key Steps in Defining, Implementing, and Using POltfolios" lists five of the key steps in the process, starting with the specification of purpose. All five steps are important, but clarity of purpose provides a ctitical foundation on which to base the other steps .

#### PURPOSE OF PORTFOLIOS

As with other forms of assessment, the first question to be answered in designing a portfolio is: What is the purpose of the portfolio? Without a clear understanding of purpose, portfolios are likely to be indistinguishable from unorganized collections of materials. Students need guidance in deciding what should and should not be included in a portfolio. They need to understand the purpose and develop skills in distinguishing between samples of their work that best serve the intended purpose and ones that are irrelevant to the purpose or that may even undermine it.

 **Key Steps in Defining, Implementing, and Using Portfolios**

- 1. Specify the purpose.
- 2. Provide guidelines for selecting portfolio entries.
- 4. Spedfy the evaluation a'itelia.
- 5. Use portfolios in instnlction and communication.
- 3. Define the student role in selection and self-evaluation.

Just as a photographer might select one set of photographs for use in a photography class focusing on light and composition, and quite a different set for a job interview, the selection of pieces of work for a portfolio should be guided by the purpose. Because of the variety of purposes for creating student portfolios, the entries may be quite varied. For example, the purpose of a pOitfolio might be to display evidence about student growth in writing during the school year. For the purpose of documenting growth, the poltfolio obviously must include pieces of work that span a period of time. If the period of interest is the school year, then the collection needs to include examples of student writing completed at the beginning of the year as well as ones completed at intermediate times and toward the end of the year. In contrast, a portfolio that is intended to provide evidence for certifying student achievement might include only examples of the student's recently completed best works.

Arter: Spandel: and Culham (1995) argued that there are fundamentally two global purposes for a'eating portfolios of student work: snldent assessment and instruction. These two global purposes need not be mutually exclusive. Indeed, as has been noted in previous c1upters, good assessment is an integral part of effective instnlction. The emphaSiS, however, is likely to be different when the pri.mary purpose is assessment than when the sole purpose is instruction.

When the primary purpose is enhandng snldent learning by having pupils evaluate their own work, for example, there may be little if any concern about the comparability of selections of work from one student to the next. The emphasis is more appropriately placed on teaching students how to make wise choices of the pieces of work to be included and in providing them witl1 examples of how to reflect on the quality of that work. The fact t11at Donna chooses to include a shOit stOlY she wrote while Ricardo chooses a book review for his pOltfolio is of less concern than the basis eacl1 student had for choosing the work and their reflections on the work. On the other hand, if the purpose of the portfolio is to provide a partial basis for detennining a smdent's grade, t11en comparability of the type of work included in the pOitfolio may be quite important. In the latter case, me teacher nuy want to specify that all students should include both a short story and a book review that mey wrote.

Although the relative emphasis on instruction and assessment is one way of distinguishing t11e different purposes of portfolios, it is not the only dimension of impoltance. Other authors have distinguished between portfolios that are intended to display current accomplishments and ones intended to demonstrate progress. Within either of t11ese general purposes, distinctions can be made between pOltfolios that contain only examples

of "best work," which are commonly called showcase pOitfolios, and pOitfolios that document a range of accomplisrunents, which are commonly called documentation portfolios. Showcase portfolios often include only comple ted products, though this is not necessarily the case. The key feature is that students believe tha t the work included shows them at their best. Portfolios that emphasize documentation, on the other hand, are generally more comprehensive than a showcase pottfolio and may include examples of work that a student considers below par as well as examples that are exemplaty. Thus, documentation portfolios would place more emphasis on "typical work. "

Another way in which pottfolios may be distinguished is the degree to which a portfolio is a dynamically evolving collection of work or a finished collection. Finished portfolios are more likely to be used for summative eva luation purposes, whereas working portfolios, which contain examples of work as it evolves, are more useful for the formative evaluation that guides student learning on a day-to-day basis. Working portfolios often include student questions as well as notes, outlines, initial drafts, revised drafts, the final product, and self-evaluations of the work.

The four characteristics just described as if they were dichotomies---(l) instruction and assessment, (2) current accomplishments and progress, (3) showcase and documentation, and (4) finished and working portfolios- are best thought of as dimensions or continua. The purpose may involve varying degrees of the poles of each continuum. That is, the poles represent relative emphases rather than sharp dichotomies. For example, although the emphasis may be on documentation, there is no implication that there should be an exhaustive inclusion of all work products. Indeed, you would usually want to encourage students to be selective and include examples of work that they believe is high quality  (best work). However with the emphasis on documentation you would also expect students to include pottfolio entries that document work in areas that may not be areas of strength or that they are not particularly proud of and those would not be included in a showcase pottfolio.

Recognizing that there are gradations between the poles of the four dimensions and that most portfolios involve a combination of the extremes, it is still useful to highlight aspects of each characteristic.

##### **Instructional Purposes**

A variety of distinctions may be made within each of the two global purposes of portfolios identified by Alter and her colleagues (1995). For example, when the primaly purpose of a portfolio is inst11.1ction, the portfolio might be used as a means of helping students develop and refine self-evaluation skills. Learning to evaluate one's own work is an

| FOllr Dimensions Distinguishing the Purposes of Portfolios |   |   |               |  |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----|----|---------------|--|--|
| Instruction                                                | <- | -> | Assessment    |  |  |
| CunÂ·ent Accomplishments                                    | <- | -> | Progress      |  |  |
| Best Work Showcase                                         | <- | -> | Documentation |  |  |
| Finished                                                   | <- | -> | Working       |  |  |

important instructional goal for all students. Skills in self-evaluation are clitical for student development as independent learners.

As is true of other important instructional goals, self-evaluation skills require practice and feedback. Well-designed portfolios of student work often include not only examples of student work that the student selects but also self-reflection and conunentary on the work. The combination of selected work and self-reflection can provide the teacher with both infonnation about the student's achievement and a window on the student's self -evaluation skills. The portfolio can also be the focus of discussion between a teacher and a student about perfonnance expectations and criteria of excellence, thereby helping the student internalize standards to be used in the evaluation of his or her own work.

Portfolios can also be used as the focus of student-directed conferences with parents and teachers. When a student presents and explains the examples of work in the portfolio to his or her parents, both the teacher and the parents have an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the student's thought processes and awareness of standards for judging the quality of the work. The teacl1er can then use this understanding of the student to plan and implement future instruction and interventions.

Another impoltant instructional use of a poltfolio is in teaching students to conununicate with different audiences. For a portfolio designed to be used as the focus of a studentdirected conference with parents, the intended auruence is obviously d1e student's parents. Students might be encouraged to think about examples of work that would let their parents see what they have learned. For high school students, potentially important audiences in addition to teachers and parents include employers and colleges. Other students may also be an important audience for the portfolio as a whole or for selected entries in portfolio for example an entry in portfolio might include an oral  presentation to the class. The altifacts that might be included in the physical portfolio could be exhibits or copies of overhead slides d1at the student prepared for use in the presentation, an oudine or notes prepared for the presentation, the student's self-evaluation, and evaluations provided by other students. The entty might also include an audio recording or even a videotape of the presentation.

##### **Assessment Purposes**

When the emphasis of a portfolio is on assessment, it is important to distinguish between the **formative** and **summative** roles of assessment. Portfolios of work collected over the course of a semester or a school year can be particularly effective for purposes of formative evaluation of student progress. A simple comparison of essays written in September, November, and February, for example, can provide a teacher with concrete examples of areas where the student has shown considerable progress (e.g. , organization and voice) and areas where there has been little improvement (e.g. , grammar and punctuation).

A pOltfolio of work might also be used as a basis for cenifying accomplishment. If portfolios are to be lISed as the basis of assigning grades or certifying accomplishments, then students should be given clear specifications of the contents of the portfolio and the scoring criteria that will be used.

At some high schools, a pOltfolio of work may provide the primary documentation lIsed to determine the award of diplomas. Central Park East Secondary School in New York City provides one of the best-known examples of the use of a graduation portfolio. Ai; will be seen, considerable effort has to go into the development of guidelines for portfolios and to the criteria used for judging their quality when they are used for such a high-stakes purpose as high school graduation.

In some states and districts, portfolios are used as palt of the system accountability requirements. For example, in Kentucky and Vermont, the state assessment system has included an evaluation of portfolios of student writing. At the district level, Pittsburgh provides a highly regarded example of the use of portfolios of student work as part of system accountability. Such large-scale uses of portfolios for assessment reqUire a higher degree of uniformity of the portfolios and more refined scoring systems than are needed for pOltfolios designed and used by classroom teachers. Nonetheless, experience with such systems provides useful information for teachers when planning their own portfolios or when working to develop a schoolwide portfolio system. We will return to these examples when considering guidelines for portfolios.

##### **Current Accomplishments and Progress**

The distinction between portfolios that emphasize current accomplishments and ones that focus on progress are fairly self-evident. 'When the focus is on accomplishments, portfolios usually are limited to finished work and may cover only a relatively brief period of time. When the focus is on demonstrating growth and development, the time frame is generally longer. A possibly less obvious distinction is that a portfolio focusing on progress will often include multiple versions of a single piece of work. For example, a writing project might include an initial outline, notes taken while doing the background reading,for the project  first draft, a self-evaluation of that draft as well as comments from the teacher or from other students on the draft, possibly a second draft with comments, and a final version of the report or essay.

##### **Showcase and Documentation Portfolios**

Showcase portfolios usually should contain sUldent-selected entries. That does not mean that students should not have the benefit of the reactions of other students or of teacher advice on how to select and evaluate the entries of a showcase portfolio; but an impoltant goal of a showcase portfolio is for students to learn to identify work that best demonstrates what they know and can do with a specific purpose and audience in mind. The documentation pOitfolio, on the other hand, usually is intended to provide evidence about breadth as well as depth of learning. Thus, it needs to be more inclusive and not be limited to areas of special strength for a student.

##### **Finished and Working Portfolios**

The label *finished* may be an overstatement. It simply implies that the work is completed for use with a particular audience. A job application portfolio, for example, is obviously finished as far as the prospective employer is concerned at the tin1e it is submitted. On the other hand, it might be refined before it is submitted as part of another job application. As the name suggests, the intent of a working portfolio is one that is expected to evolve and should not be held up to the summative evaluation standards that may be appropriate for a finished portfolio. Working pOltfolios are often used to document day-to-day activities and are most useful for formative evaluation purposes. The working portfolio can provide the teacher with timely information about clay-to-day progress and be a means of providing students with formative feedback for use in refining or revising their work. It is critical that students not be penalized for expressing ideas that may be incorrect or that display a lack of understanding in working portfolios. The working portfolio is most useful when students are encouraged to express themselves freely and are given timely feedback on their work. Thus, there are obviously work implications for the teacher, ones that should not be entered into lightly at the peak of enthusiasm about the use of working portfolios.

#### **GUIDELINES FOR PORTFOLIO ENTRIES**

The full purpose of a palticular portfolio will be a combination of the four dimensions just discussed. Clearly specifying that purpose to students provides the foundation for developing portfolios. Alone, however, the purpose will not give students sufficient guidance. The purpose needs to be accompanied by clear guidelines for tile construction of portfolios.

The guidelines need to be specific enough so that students know what is expected without being overly constraining. One of tile appeals of a pOltfolio is its fleXibility. Too mush specification can stifle student creativity and thwart the goal of self refelction and being responsible for their own learning. On tile other hand, too little specificity leaves students in the dark about what is considered an approptiate enlly. When portfolios are used for summative evaluation purposes, the lack of specificity is likely to be a source of unfairness. Students who cllOose to pursue an activity that is not valued in the ctiteria used for evaluation or that does not provide the opportunity to display valued skills may be put at a disadvantage in compatison to students who cll00se other activities.

At a minimum, guidelines should specify (a) the uses mat will be made of the portfolio, (b) who will have access to it, (c) what types of work are appropriate to include, and Cd) what criteria will be used in evaluating the work. For example, if the portfolio is to be used as the basis for student-directed conferences with parents, students obviously should know that tlleir parents are an important audience. Students need to know if the portfolios are supposed to contain only finished work or if mey are supposed to include illustrations of the process of planning, beginning and intermediate stages of tile work, and the final product. They need to know the range of acceptable entries. For example, are tape recordings, models, or videos appropriate to include? Or should the portfolio be limited to paper-and-pencil entries?

Although the physical form of a pOltfolio is secondary to me purpose, there are practical issues concerning storage and philosophical issues regarding the degree to which vatious media other than paper and pencil should be encouraged or allowed to be part of the pOitfolio. Concerns for equal access to me means to create videotapes or computer presentations, for example, are important considerations in this regard. These concerns interact with pUlpose. Unequal access to resources is generally of greatest concern when portfolios are used for summative evaluation purposes, such as the assignment of grades or to detelmine awards or other types of honors, because the differences in access to resources may lead to real or perceived unfairness.

Another critical guideline concerns the role of collaboration with others in doing the work. Frequently, portfolios include examples of both independent work and work that is done collaboratively by small groups of students. For some entries, it may be appropriate to include the suggestions of peers or of parents t11at are used to revise the entIy. The guidelines need to be explicit about the ground rules for working independently or obtaining various kinds of assistance from others. The ground rules may be constant for all entries in a portfolio or may vary from one entry to anotl1er, but in either case t11ey need to be clearly stated.

The guidelines should define the time line for the pOltfolio as well as the minimum and possibly the maximum number of entries. The variety of entries in tenns of both form (e.g., letter, narrative essay, book review, or persuasive essay) and content (e.g. , topics or historical periods) should be specified in the guidelines, making a clear distinction between required and optional entries.

The guidelines may also specify the physical structure of the portfolio (e.g., a binder or a computer disc) and its contents. For example, guidelines might specify that the portfolio include a table of contents, a cover sheet describing each entry, and a self-reflection on each entry. lnCI'eased access to and use of computers has led to increased use of electronic portfolios or for palts of the portfolio to be kept and stored electronically. Indeed, it is increasingly likely that students use computers when they type an essay or report in the first place. With a scanner, even handwritten essays and many figures can also be incorporated into an electronic portfolio. Students with access to t11e internet may readily download a wide anay of materials that can be used to illustrate aspects of works.

Students also must be infonned about how the evaluation of the portfolio will influence their grades. Both entty-specific criteria in the fonn of scoring rubrics or cl1ecklists and o'iteria for combining entt'y-by-entty evaluations into an overall evaluation of the complete portfolio need to be included in the guidelines.

##### **An Example of a Graduation Portfolio**

Darling-Hammond, Ancess, and Falk (1995) provide a detailed description of the Central Park East graduation portfolio. The portfolio is the culmination of a student's last 2 or 3 years of work in the Senior Institute, which is a division of the school conesponding to the junior and senior years of high school. The graduation poltfolios completed during the 2 or possibly 3 years a student is in the Senior Institute has requirements in 14 categories. These 14 categories are listed in Table 12.1 along with a brief description of each portfolio entty.

Note that the portfolio entries in Table 12.1 are broadly defined. They include not only written materials, but possibly a variety of forms of oral presentations such as a speech, a debate, or a play. Works of art and various types of exhibits such as a science demonstration or a model may also be included. Audiotapes, videotapes, and computer discs may also be used as part of a portfolio ently.

##### Examples of Statewide and Districtwide Portfolio Guidelines

Vermont was the first state to introduce portfolios as the primalY state assessment. POItfo-Iios in mathematics and writing were collected statewide for students in grades 4 and 8. The mathematics pOltfolios required students and teachers to pick five to seven "best"

 Criteria Used for Rating Mathematics Portfolios in Vermont

- How you solved the problem

pieces of work. The pOttfolios were sent to a central location where they were rated by volunteer teachers on a 4-point scale for each of seven different dimensions. Four of the dimensions were related to aspects of problem solving; the other three dealt with aspects of communication (see the box "Cliteria Used for Rating Mathematics Portfolios in Vermont").

The Vermont writing portfolios had great specificity in the required contents. At grade 4, for example, a student's portfolio was supposed to include the following (Koretz, Stecher, Klein, & McCaffrey, 1994a, p. 4):

- 1. Table of contents
- 2. Single best piece, which is selected by the student, and can come from any class and need not address an academic subject
- 3. Letter explaining the composition and selection of the best piece
- 4. Poem, short stoty, or personal narration
- 5. Personal response to a book, event, cunent issue, mathematics problem, or scientific phenomenon
- 6. Prose piece from any subject area other than English or language arts

The writing pottfolios were scored in two parts: (1) the best piece, and (2) the rest of the portfolio. Four-point rating scales were used for each of five dimensions (purpose, organization, details, voice/ tone, and usage/grammar/mechanics) when rating the best piece and the rest of the writing portfolio.

Evaluations of the Vermont portfolios suppolted two major conclusions. First, on the positive side, the use of portfolios was found to have positive effects on classroom practice. This conclusion was supported by teacher reports of how the work on portfolios affected their day-ta-day instructional practices and by independent observations. The professional development gained through teachers working together on the scoring and sharing thoughts on what constitutes exemplary student work was also seen as a major benefit of the effott. Second, on the negative side, there was relatively poor intenater reliability in the central scoring process. Thus, the evaluation by Koretz and his colleagues was mixed, concluding on the one hand that the reliability was inadequate for accountability purposes but that on the other hand the effects on instruction were generally positive (Koretz, Stecher, Klein, & McCaffrey, 1994b).

Another example of a major effort in using portfolios for large-scale assessment comes from Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Public School District undertook a clistrictwide effort to evaluate student writing in grades 6 through 12 using portfolios. The portfolios werecreated by having students select four examples of their work using a set of district guidelines. For each example, students were required to include drafts as well as the final version of the writing. They also were required to include a written reflection on the entry and to answer several questions about it and their experience in writing it. Guidelines for selecting the four pieces of writing spedfied that they should include (a) a piece that the student considered to be "important," (b) a piece that the student considered to be "satisfying," (c) a piece that the student considered to be "unsatisfying," and (d) a "free pick." Students were also required to complete a table of contents, a writing inventOlY about their experience as a writer, and a "final reflection" in which they were asked to review their writings and "describe changes in their wIiting and in themselves as writers" (LeMahieu, Gitomer, & Eresh, 1995, p. 12).

All students were expected to complete a writing portfolio using th e previously mentioned guidelines. A random sample of 1,250 portfolios was scored along the three major dimensions shown in Table 12.2 using a 6-point scale ranging from "inadequate" to "outstanding" performance for each dimension . Considerable developmental work with teacl1ers and administrators before the districtwide applications went into identifying the

elements (shown as bullets in Table 12.2) that contributed to the definition of varying degrees of adequacy of the performance on eacll of the three dimensions.
The portfolios were judged by a relatively small cadre of teachers (12 raters for the midcUe scllool portfolios and 13 raters for the high school pOltfolios) who were trained and calibrated using preselected portfolios as benchmarks or ancllors for the scale points on the three dimensions. All portfolios were independently scored by two of the trained raters, and an arbitration process with a third reader was used in cases where differences in scores assigned by the two raters were greater than 1 point. Otherwise, the score for the portfolio was the average of ilie two independent ratings.

The rating process for the 1,250 pOltfolios took a total of 815 person-hours over the period of a week. Clearly, this was no trivial undeltaking to score the random sample of 8% of the students in the district. The results, however, were exceptional. Relatively high interrater reliability was achieved (reliability coefficients between .74 to .80 for the three dimensions for high sdlool and .84 to .87 for midcUe school portfolios). The title of the atticle about the Pittsburgh experience sums up a major conclusion of the effolt: "Portfolios in Large-Scale Assessment: Difficult but Not Impossible" (LeMahieu et aI., 1995). Like Kmetz and his colleagues (1995), LeMahieu and associates also conclude that the portfolio effOlt had positive effects on instl1.lction. The difference is that they showed that-witll sufficient planning, specification of portfolio gUidelines, refinement of scoring procedures, and rater trainingit is also possible to achieve acceptable levels of reliability for the portfolio ratings.

##### **Examples of Classroom Portfolio Guidelines**

Classroom use of portfolio for assessing student work need not be as comprehensive as a high school graduation pOltfolio or as tightly defined as a portfolio used in a statewide or districtwide assessment to report on the progress of schools, districts, and the state. It is nonetheless critical for the classroom teacher to be clear on the purpose, the expectations for what should be included in tile portfolio, the responsibilities of students for selecting and evaluating their work, and the criteria that will be used in evaluating the work. Sometimes, as in the following example, broad guidelines are available from the state or district to help teachers in implementing a pOltfolio. Such guidelines can be adapted by eacll teacher to provide students with more specific instlUctions for completing their portfolios.

An Ex..llnple of a High School Science Portfolio. The California Golden State Exam (GSE) science portfolio consisted of a collection of student work based on a year of study in a high school course in biology, chemiStry, or second-year coordinated science. Evaluations of portfolios are combined with other sections of the GSE in tile subject area to award recognition to students for their performance on the GSE. The California Department of Education's "Golden State Examination Science POltfolio: A Guide to Teachers" (available at http://www.nwrel.org/assessment/toolkit98/ folio.html) provides sample activities and explicates scoring guides for the entlies. Sample activities include the following:

- **1.** A problem-solving investigation, sllch as
	- a student-generated laboratOlY investigation (e.g., detennine the effectiveness of household cleaning fluids for controlling the growth of bacteria-idea conttibuted to guidelines by Kasey Smith-Penner, Sequoia High School, Redwood City),
    - Â· a field experience (e.g., conduct a study of aspects of soil, flora, fauna, or climate on a 1-meter plot of land and relate it to environmental issues in the community-idea contributed to guidelines by Joe Mahood, Aragon High School, San Mateo), or
    - Â· a research investigation (e.g., predict the risk of developing an ailment such as cancer or AIDS in student's community-idea contributed to guidelines by Netta Freeman, Paduca High School, Tilghham, Kentucky).
- 2. A creative expression entry displaying a scientific result or finding, for example,
	- Â· games,
	- Â· video,
	- Â· art, or
	- poetry.
- 3. An example of growth through writing, illustrating relevant findings or issues in science, using, for example,
	- Â· current events or
	- Â· original stories.
- 4. GSE self-reflection sheet, requiring students to
	- Â· identify the scientific concept for the entry,
	- Â· explain why the entry is an excellent way to show the concept, and
	- Â· describe how the entry shows the concept.

An Example of a Primary School Mathematics Portfolio. Leon Paulson developed guidelines for the Multnomah (Oregon) Educational Service District to help give teachers ideas about the development and use of mathematics portfolios for students in the primary grades (Paulson, 1994). His "Portfolio Guidelines in Primary Math" are available at http:// www.nwrel.org/assessment/toolkit98/primary.html. Some of the kinds of things Paulson's guidelines encourage teachers to have students include in their portfolios are the following:

- Â· Use of manipulatives-documented for portfolio where feasible by drawings or photographs
- Â· Use of technology-computer and calculators with written or recorded oral statements about results
- Â· Use of group work to solve problems-might include teacher observations or recorded student interactions and statements about individual contributions
- Â· Use of real-world examples of applications of mathematics outside class with written or recorded oral statements about examples
- Â· Use of interdisciplinary problems-examples of mathematics, graphs, and charts from other subject areas
- Â· Use of journals and class publications-keep a mathematics journal in portfolios

Writing Portfolios. In a content area such as writing, it is natural to ask: What is the difference between a traditional writing assessment and a writing portfolio assessment? The answer, of course, depends on what sort of "traditional writing assessment" and what sort of "writing portfolio assessment" you are talking about. Answers given to this question by Gearhalt, Herman, Baker, and Whittaker (1992) for their study of writing portfolios provide a list of differences that are likely to be applicable in varying degrees in comparing writing portfolios to writing assessments where students are given a prompt and asked to write an essay in a set period of time, such as a single class period. Gearhart and her colleagues noted that the writing portfolios that they developed and analyzed differed from such traditional writing assessments in the following five ways.

- l. Portfolios contained samples of classroom writing that occurred in a wide range of conditions and that might address a variety of topics rather than responses to prompts under standardized conditions and time limits.
- 2. Portfolios contained multiple and varied forms of writing samples obtained in varied contexts over a period of time rather than responses to a single or limited number of prompts at a single point in time.
- 3. Portfolios included considerable variation in the types or genres of writing tasks (e.g., narratives, summaries, or letters) rather than a task from a single genre.
- 4. Portfolios gave more of a window into the writing process by the inclusion of drafts and repeated revisions rather than only a single draft of an essay.
- S. Portfolios contained a variety of supplemental materials, such as notes, student reflections on the writing experience, self-evaluations, and evaluations by others (e.g., teacher, peer, and/ or parents), rather than only the written response to a prompt.

All these factors contribute to the richness of the information that a well-planned and well implemented portfolio assessment ccan provide. These factors can also complicate  challenges of rating the work or using it as the basis of assigning grades. For example, if the portfolio is intended to assess student progress, then the wide variation in types and genres of writing makes comparison extremely difficult. Based on work with writing portfolios in Hawaii, for example, Baker and Linn (1992) found it almost impossible to achieve consistent ratings of progress when "comparing an October folk tale with a December fantasy, a January haiku, a March whale report, a May letter to a pen pal, and a June summalY of a field trip" (p. 12). Though still a challenge, it is much easier to evaluate progress by comparing perfonnance within a single genre (e.g., narrative essays) over time.

In addition to the five differences noted by Gearhart and her colleagues (1992), portfolios also differ from traditional essay or performance assessments in that they may include work that has a substantial collaborative component. Including collaborative assessment tasks in a portfolio may enrich the learning, but it raises questions that need to be considered when the work becomes palt of the evaluation of an individual student's work: How should the groups be formed-by student choice or by teacher assignment? How much does it matter if the groups are homogeneous or heterogeneous in achievement? Whose work is it, and what specializations may have evolved for the group?

Many examples of portfolios can be found on the internet. A quick search will often lead to good examples in specific content areas. However, pOitfolios are best when adapted to the local context, and the internet examples should be used only as a statting point for planning and implementing portfolios.

#### **GUIDELINES AND STUDENTS' ROLE IN SELECTION OF PORTFOLIO ENTRIES AND SELF-EVALUATION**

Much of the strength of a portfolio depends on students' involvement in the selection of work to include and on their reflections on that work. Hence, it is important to have students involved in the selection of portfolio entries. This does not mean that students can simply include anything they dlOose. Rather, teachers need to give students dear gUidelines for selecting pieces of work. l1l0se guidelines should be based on the purpose of the portfolio and the learning goals that dle teacher is tlying to foster.

If the goal in a science dass is that students should "know and be able to use the experimental method ," then the guidelines should ensure that students not only describe the experimental method or respond to questions in an assignment about it but also apply the method to answer a specific question. Guidelines for the pOltfolio entry might specify that the entry include a description of the problem, a statement of the hypodlesis to be tested, tile design and data collection procedures to be used, the data collected, the analysis of results, and a statement of condusions. The guidelines might suggest a range of appropriate problems for experimentation or provide a list of example problems. The student would still have considerable latitude, however, in the choice of the particular problem, in determining the details of the experimental design, in planning the analyses, and in interpreting the data.

In a Spanish-language class, students might be asked to include tape recordings of their conversation with a speaker whose first language is Spanish, an essay written in Spanish, and a translation of a letter from Spanish to English. In each of these categories, the range of topics as well as other characteristics, such as a minimum duration of the recorded conversation or the type of letter, might be specified. The key is to provide students with latitude for exercising their creativity and gaining experience in setting goals, planning, and conducting the work while achieving specific instructional objectives.

In both the science experiment example and the Spanish class example, students have substantial room to define and shape the details of poltfolio entries, as well as clear guidelines on the nature of the work to be induded. A review of an experiment conducted by someone else or the summary of what is known about a topic dearly would not qualify as an example of a student's use of ilie experimental meiliod. Sin1ilarly, a tape recording of a student reading a passage from a Spanish-language magazine would not meet the requirement for a tape-recorded conversation wiili a person whose flfst language is Spanish.

To help students reflect on their choice of entries for a portfolio, it is useful not only to have guidelines specifying requirements but also to have students complete a brief form with each entry. An example of such a form is shown in Figure 12.1. In addition to identifying the entry widl the student's name and a blief description, the form provides encouragement for students to think about why ilie particular entty was selected and what they consider its salient features. By including a place for teadler comments on the same form, the cover sheet provides a lasting record in the poltfolio of the feedback provided to the student.

A separate form, as shown in Figure 12.2, may provide more expliCit guidelines on student reflections on the ently and their self-evaluation of its strengdls and weaknesses.

Figure 12.2 Sample self-reflection and evaluation form

The prompts on the form are intended to encourage students to think about what they planned to do and what they actually did, and to evaluate the strong and weak points of the entry. By asking students to say what they might do differently next time, students are encouraged to think about how their work might be improved.

#### EVALUATION CRITERIA

To specify evaluation criteria, a teacher must be clear in his or her mind about the instructional goals for individual portfolio entries and for the portfolio as a whole. If the instructional goals are not clear already to the teacher, efforts to specify evaluation criteria will either force reconsideration and clarification of goals or risk being irrelevant or even counterproductive. The evaluation criteria should clarify instructional goals not only for the teacher but for students and parents as well.

The clear specification of evaluation criteria enhances fairness. As with any other type of assessment, students need to know what is expected and how their work will be evaluated if a portfolio assessment is to be fair to students in reality and to be so perceived by students and parents. Of course, evaluation criteria are also important to help teachers be consistent and unbiased in scoring portfolios of different students.

The place to start in developing evaluation criteria for portfolios is with the specified purpose or purposes of the portfolio. Analytic scoring rubrics on individual portfolios are useful for formative evaluation purposes. Holistic scoring rubrics may be more appropriate for summative evaluations. The formative distinction is also useful in determining the emphasis of evaluation rubrics for individual portfolio entries and ones designed for evaluating the complete portfolio.

The evaluation criteria for individual entries may be specified using the various types of scoring rubrics and rating scales discussed in Chapters 10 and 11. The narrative scoring rubric used by Wolf and Gearhart (1997) that was discussed in Chapter 10, for example, might be used as the basis for evaluating narrative essays included in an English/language arts portfolio. Accordingly, both the student and the teacher might judge each narrative essay entry in terms of the effectiveness of the development of the essay theme, the characters, the setting, and the plot as well as how effectively the essay communicates.

The sample items of a rating scale for a speech shown in Figure 11.5 in Chapter 11 might be used for rating a videotape of a student presentation. Those items might be completed by the teacher, the student whose presentation was videotaped, and by other students.

Scoring rubrics used at Central Park East Secondary School for evaluating portfolio entries define 4-point scales on each of five dimensions of performance: (1) viewpoint, (2) connections, (3) evidence, (4) voice, and (5) conventions. Viewpoint concerns the degree to which the entry demonstrates a wide knowledge base while maintaining a clear focus. To obtain a score of 4 on the viewpoint dimension, the entry must clearly display an in-depth understanding of ideas and issues and persuasively present a coherent position while acknowledging other views as appropriate.

The connections rubric distinguishes between well-organized and interconnected entries with a clear beginning and end, and ones that do not clearly connect the parts into a coherent whole. The evidence rubric provides the basis for evaluating the degree to which evidence is used to support arguments and conclusions in a credible and convincing way. The voice dimension is used to evaluate the degree to which the entJy is engaging for the intended audience. The overall appearance, format, and appropriate use of sentence structure, grammar, and the mechanics of punctuation and spelling are evaluated by the conventions scoring rubric (for a more complete description, see Darling-Hammond e t al., 1995, pp. 36-39).

Guidelines to help teachers implement the ponfolio requirements in their classrooms for the California Golden State Exam included descriptions of the score points for each type of entry. Six score levels are defined for each type of pOltfolio ently , ranging from inadequate performance (1) to exceptional perfonnance (6). An example of one of the descriptions of a score of 5 for the problem-solving investigation is given in the box "Problem-Solving Investigation: Score Level 5."

In addition to evaluation a-iteria for individual entries, a-iteria may also be specified for evaluating the structure of the pOltfolio and for the overall evaluation of the entire collection. The evaluation of structure may include ratings of the organization, the appearance, and the quality of self-reflections.

An overall evaluation of the portfolio that cuts aa-oss entJÂ·ies is espedally useful for portfolios intended to assess student progress. Specific ratings might be provided on dimensions such as those shown in Table 12.3. Each of the rating scales in the table emphasizes comparisons among portfolio items that were added to the portfolio at different times during the year.

When judgmental scoring is required of assessments for purposes of grading or other summative evaluations, it is good practice to conceal the identity of the student. This can sometimes be accomplished on essay examinations by scoring one item at a time and shuffling the order of the examinations after completing the scoring of each item. With projects or extended repons, it is usually more difficult to conceal the student's identity while grading the work, but it may be possible in some instances by instTUcting students to put their names only on a cover page or at the end of the work. Such procedures, though seldom foolproof, can also be used when evaluating individual portfolio entries. For global ratings of the pOltfolio as a whole, however, it is nearly impossible to conceal the student's identity from the teacller when he or she is evaluating the pOltfolio. Thus, other approaches are needed to guard against unintended biases that arise when a teacher

##### Problem-Solving Investigation: Score Level 5

"Student work and self-reflection show the student's strong skill in experimental design. Observations and data analysis indicate very good knowledge of the sdentific ideas presented. Analyses and conclusions are supported by observations and data and show a high level of reasoning. The entlY includes strong evidence that the student worked cooperatively with others. The

self-reflection sheet clearly identifies how working with others improved the student's understanding of the sdentific ideas presented. The student makes generally valid applications to real-world situations. All aspects of the task and analysis are complete. Written expression is very good and contributes to clear and coherent communication" (California Department of Education, 1994).

gives the benefit of the doubt because the teacher "knows" that the student "understands the material based on other observations" or rates the work of a student who rarely does good work more harshly because of this preconception.

One useful safeguard against unintended biases that arise in ratings of portfolios from knowledge of the student's identity *is* to rescore a portfolio after setting it aside for a period of time and to compare the two sets of scores. Where teachers from different classes collaborate on assessments, it may also be possible to exchange some pOltfolios so that each teacher scores the portfolios of some of the students from the other class. Comparing the scores assigned to your own students with the scores assigned by another teacher can be useful not only in guarding against tmintended scoring biases but also in refining scoring rubrics and enhancing reliability of scoring. Obviously, it is not always possible to have pOltfolios independently scored by another teacher. Where it is feasible, however, it can be the basis for fruitful discussions between the teachers regarding instructional goals, the adequacy of the evidence collected in tlle portfolio to evaluate tlle achievement of those goals, and the evaluation criteria that are used.

When portfolios are used on a schoolwide, districtwide, or statewide basis as part of an accountability system, a more formal scoring process should be employed. Teachers may be brought together and trained to use common scoring criteria. Benchmark or anchor papers for eacl1 entry may be identified and used to elaborate the meaning of scoring rubrics and to train teachers to use C0nu110n scoring standards. Independent audit procedures may also be used where a random sample of portfolios *is* selected for rescoring at a central site. Although such a training and scoring enterprise requires substantial time and resources,

teachers in locations where this is done have frequently reported that tlle experience is one of the best professional development activities with whidl tlley have been involved.

#### **USING PORTFOLIOS IN INSTRUCTION AND COMMUNICATION**

Most appropriate uses are, of course, either the explicit or the implldt fOCllS of the purposes for which pOitfolios are introduced. Thus, we have already said quite a bit about the primary uses of portfolios for purposes of instruction and assessment. Here we need only add a few specific points about the relationship of portfolios to instruction and elaborate on the idea of using portfolios to communicate to others outside the classroom, especially parents or guardians.

A salient feature of portfolios is the dynamiC way in whicll they evolve over days, weeks, and months. As students work on individual entries, teacl1ers have many opportunities to examine the work and discuss ideas on possible next steps with students. Observations of portfolios in progress provide teachers with a basis for ongoing planning and formative evaluation.

Portfolios also provide an excellent means of communicating with parents. The products and student self-reflections can provide parents with a window into the classroom. It gives them a more intimate basis for seeing aspects of their children's experiences in school. As was previously noted, portfolios can also be used as a vehicle for student-directed conferences of students, parents, and teachers. The specifics of me portfolio provide a framework for meaningful three-way discussions of the student's achievements, progress, and areas to work on next. Parents' comments on the spedfic entries and overall portfolio can also contribute to and become part of the portfolios.

#### **SUMMARY**

Portfolios come in many different varieties and can serve an equally wide array of purposes. What distinguishes a portfolio of student work from merely a file where student work is collected and stored is that a portfolio is a purposeful collection of student work. Clear definition of purpose is one of me most impoltant steps in planning the uses of pOitfolios. Clarity of purpose provides the foundation for determining the contents of a portfolio, how entties will be selected, and how the portfolio will be evaluated.

The two primary purposes for using portfolios in me classroom are instruction and assessment. Although most portfolios serve some mix of these two purposes, it is critical that the relative emphasis be clarified before work begins on the construction of portfolios. As with other assessments, it is important to distinguish between using the portfolio for purposes of formative or sununative evaluation. The formative llSes are readily compatible with portfolios mat are intended to be used primarily as an instructional tool. Summative evaluation uses, sllch as grades and the award of honors, may also contribute to leaming, but issues of comparability from student to student and fairness constrain the freedom with which portfolios can be constructed.

Portfolio purposes can also be distinguished in terms of the emphasis placed. on current achievement or progress over time, the use of portfolios as a showcase of best work or for purposes of documentation, and whether they are finished or working portfolios.

Guidelines should provide students with a sound understanding of what is expected and a reasonable basis for selecting entries. These guidelines obviously need to be congruent with the purposes. They must be specific enough so that students know what they need to do but not so specific that they stifle the creativity and freedom of choice that is reasonable within the constraints of the portfolio's purpose.

Guidelines should specify the contents, types, and minimum number of entries that students are expected to include. The guidelines should be clear about intended audiences and about who has access to the portfolio. ReqUirements for self-reflection and self-evaluation of both the entries and the pOitfolio as a whole should be stated in the guidelines. Finally, guidelines should clarify the evaluation criteria that will be used in judging entries and portfolios as a whole.

As is true of any instructional assessment tool, pOltfolios have both strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most important strengths are the ease with which they can be integrated with classroom instruction; their value in encouraging students to develop self-evaluation skills, take responsibility for their own learning, and become reflective learners; and their effectiveness in communicating with parents and other audiences outside the classroom. Two frequently cited weaknesses or drawbacks are that portfolios are labor intensive for the teacher- requiring considerable time in planning, monitoring, and proViding feedback to students- and that they are difficult to score reliably.

### **CHAPTER 13: ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES: OBSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES, PEER APPRAISAL, AND SELF-REPORT** 

Direct observation is the best means we have for assessing some aspects of leaming and development. The lise of anecdotal records can tum informal teacher observations into a systematic source of infonnation about student development. Judgments and repolts made by students themselves are also a valuable source of information in many areas of leaming and development. Peer iudgments are especially lIseful in assessing personal-social development, and self-report methods provide a fuller understanding of students' needs. problems, adjustments, interests, and attitudes.

Many outcomes in the cognitive domain, SUcll as those pertaining to knowledge, lmderstanding, and thinking skills, can be measured by paper-and-pencil tests or performance-based assessments. However, there also are many important leaming outcomes that require infonnal obselvation of natural interactions in the classroom, on the playground, or in the lunchroom. In this chapter, we focus on procedures for observing and recording student perfonnances in natural settings throughout the school year. These techniques are also useful for assessing impoltant noncognitive outcomes, such as attitudes, appreciations, and personal-social development. We also describe procedures for complementing teacher observations of student development with judgments and repolts from students. Both peer reports and self-reports are the best sources of infonnation about some aspects of personal- social development and can provide valuable supplements to teacher observations in other areas.

Although we have included this cllapter in Part II of this book, the uses of some of the infonnation that can be collected by techniques discussed in this chapter often do not

differ from the information gained through the types of tests and assessments discussed in Chapters 6 through 12. Some of the informal observations may contribute, along with information obtained through more formal assessment procedures, to the evaluation of student progress and grading. Much of the information, however, will be more useful in attempting to understand student attitudes and interests and the dynamics of the classroom than for evaluating cognitive outcomes. Such information can be useful in considering what approaches will be most likely to be benefical to individual students and what arrangements and group interactions are likely to be helpful in enhancing the learning of all students.

Learning outcomes in skill areas and behavioral changes in personal-social development are especially difficult to assess with paper-and-pencil tests. A list of such outcomes, with representative types of student behavior, is presented in Table 13.1. This list is by no means complete, but it is comprehensive enough to show the great need to supplement paper-and-pencil testing with other methods of assessment. Performance-based tasks of the type discussed in Chapter 11 are well suited for the types of skills illustrated at the top of the table. The other outcomes in the table, however, require the use of informal observation techniques throughout the school year. The observational and recording techniques described in this chapter can improve the assessment of all these outcomes.

Learning outcomes and aspects of development such as those in Table 13.1 can generally be assessed by (a) observing students as they perform and describing or judging that behavior (assessing interactions with other students), (b) asking their peers about them (assessing social relationships), and (c) questioning them directly (assessing expressed interests). Although these observational techniques, peer appraisals, and self-report methods are more subjective than we would like and their use frequently requires more time and effort than typical assessment procedures, they are the best means available for assessing a variety of important behaviors. Our choice is simple: Either we use these techniques to assess each learning outcome and aspect of development as directly and validly as possible, or we neglect learning outcomes that cannot be measured by paper-and-pencil tests.

In this chapter, we describe the use of anecdotal records to systematically accumulate information from a teacher's informal observations. We then describe the use of peer appraisals and self-report techniques to supplement and complement teacher observations.

#### ANECDOTAL RECORDS

Teachers' daily observations give them a wealth of information concerning the learning and development of their students. For example, a third-grade teacher notices during oral reading that Mike mispronounces several simple words, that Maria sits staring out the window, and that Carl keeps interrupting the reading with irrelevant questions. Similarly, a high school chemistry teacher notices during a laboratory period that Bill is slow and inefficient in setting up his equipment, that Juan finishes his experiments early and helps others, and that Sandy handles the chemicals in a careless and dangerous manner despite repeated warnings. Such daily incidents and events have special significance for assessing

student learning and development. They enable us to determine how a smdent typically perfonns or behaves in a va riety of situations. In some instances, this infonnation supplements and verifies data obtained by more objective methods; but in other cases, it is the only means we have for assessing desired outcomes.

Impressions gained through o bservation are apt to provide an incomplete and biased p icture , however, unless we keep an accurate record of our observations. A simple and convenient method of doing tllis is through anecdotal records. Su ch records reduce problems caused by selective memory and can be useful not only in planning ways to interact more effectively with individual students but also in preparing for parent- teacher conferences. The specific examples recorded o n anecdotal records can provide a more effective basis for communication with parents than mere generalities.

Anecdotal records are factual descriptions of the meaningful incidents and events that the teacher has observed. Each incident sho uld be written down shOltly after it happens. The descriptions may be recorded on separate cards like the o ne shown in Figure 13.1 or as running accounts, one for each student, on separate pages in a notebook. A good anecdotal record keeps the o bjective description of an inddent separate from any interpretation of the behavior'S meaning. For some purposes, it is also usefu l to keep an additional space for recommendations concerning ways to improve the student's learning or adjustment. SUd l recommendations are seldom made, however, until several anecdotes have been recorded.

 Incident
Shortly before class was about to start. Mary showed me a poem that she had written about "spring" It was a delightful poem, and I asked her if she wanted to read it to the class. She bowed her head and then nodded yes. She read the poem in a low voice, constantly looked down at the paper, moved her right foot back and forth, and pulled on the collar of her blouse. When she finished, Steve (in the back row) said, "I couldn't hear it. Will you read it againlouder?" Mary said "no" and sat down.
Interpretation
Mary enjoys writing stories and poems, and they reflect considerable creative ability. However, she seems very shy and nervous in performing before a group. Her refusal to read the poem again seemed to be due to her nervousness.

##### Uses of Anecdotal Records

The use of anecdotal records has frequently been limited to the area of social adjustment. Although they are especially appropriate for this type of reporting, this is a needless limitation. Anecdotal records can be used for obtaining data pertinent to a variety of learning outcomes and to many aspects of personal and social development. The potential usefulness of the anecdotal method is revealed in the various areas of learning outcomes presented earlier in this chapter (see Table 13.1); you will see that many of the behaviors listed there can be appraised by means of direct observation.

The problem in using anecdotal records is not so much what can be assessed as what should be assessed with this method. It is obvious that we cannot observe and report on all aspects of student behavior no matter how useful such records might be. Thus, we must be selective in our observations.

##### What Behaviors to Observe and Record

In general, our objectives and desired outcomes will guide us in determining what behaviors are most worth noting. We must also be alert to those unusual and exceptional incidents that contribute to a better understanding of each student's unique pattern of behavior. Within this general framework are certain steps we can take to control our observations so that a realistic system of recording can be developed.

- 1. Confining our observations to those areas of behavior that cannot be assessed by other means
- 2. Limiting our observations of all students at any given time to only a few types of behavior
- 3. Restricting the use of extensive observations of behavior to those few students who are most in need of special help

There is no advantage in using anecdotal records to derive evidence of learning in areas in which more objective and practical methods are available. Knowledge, understanding, and variolls aspects of thinking skill can usually be assessed by paper-and-pencil tests. Many learning outcomes of other types that are well suited to the use of performance-based assessment tasks, sucl1 as the ability to give a speech, operate a microscope, or write a theme, are most effectively assessed by rating methods or product assessment. Records of actual behavior are best used to assess how a sUldent typically behaves in a naUlral setting. How does David approach a problem? How persistent is Rachel in canying out a task? How willing is Steve to listen to the ideas of others? What contributions does Kwang make to class activities? How willing is Kristen to participate in games with other children on the playground? What type of books does Brooke select from the library? A student's verbal comments and actions in various naUlral siUlations reveal certain clues to attitudes, interests, appreciations, habits, and social adjustment patterns that cannot be discovered by any other means. These are the types of behavior on which we should focus when keeping anecdotal records.

The best we can hope to get from anecdotal records is a fairly representative sample of student behavior in the different areas for which we want information. This usually can be obtained more easily if we concentrate our observations on a few areas at a time. For example, an elementary teacher might pay particular attention to reading interests during the free reading period, to signs of appreciation during music and alt, and to patterns of social interactions during recess. Similarly, a high school science teacher might concentrate on incidents reflecting scientific attiUlde during certain class discussions and laboratory periods and on work habits and laboratolY skills during others. In some cases, the activity itself will indicate the types of observation most fruitful to focus on, whereas in other the emphasis is at any given time may need to be detelmined. Despite the concentration of attention on certain areas at a particular time, however, we should always be alert to other incidents and events that have special Significance for understanding a sUlclent's learning and development.

In addition to recording some information on all sUldents, at times we need more comprehensive information regarding a relative few. The child struggling to learn to read, the socially rejected child, the disruptive child , and the child with a learning disability are typical of those needing special attention. More eA'tensive observations of such students are helpful in understanding their difficulties and in planning effective instructional strategies. The most complete and useful information is obtained when we concentrate our observations on one or two sUldents at a time. During such observations it also may be necessalY to restrict our record keeping on other students.

Some teachers become discouraged when they first use anecdotal records because they attempt to do too much. limiting obselvations and reports to specific types of behavior, to specific students, or both is frequently necessary to make the procedure feasible. It is much better to have a clearly delimited and workable observational plan than to end up with an incomplete and atypical collection of unrelated incidents.

##### **Advantages and Limitations of Anecdotal Records**

Probably the most important advantage of anecdotal records is that they depict actual behavior in natural siUlations. The old adage that "actions speak louder than words" has a direct application here. A student may show good knowledge of health practices but violate them in evelyday situations, may profess great interest in sdence but approach laboratory work in a haphazard and uninterested fashion, or may express great concern for the welfare of others but behave in a selfish manner. Records of actual behavior provide a check on other assessment methods and also enable us to detennine the extent of change in the student's typical patterns of behavior.

In addition to compiling descriptions of the most characteristic behavior of a student, anecdotal records fadlitate gathering evidence on events that are exceptional but significant. Typical examples are the quiet student who speaks in class for the first time, the hostile student who makes a friendly gesture, the extreme conformist who shows a sign of originality, and the apathetic student who shows a spark of interest. These individually significant behaviors are apt to be excluded by other assessment techniques. They are also likely to be overlooked by teachers unless a concerted effort is made to observe such incidents. Keeping anecdotal records makes us more diligent in observation and increases our awareness of such behaviors.

Anecdotal records can be used with very young students and with students who have limited basic communication skills. They are especially valuable in sinlations where paperand-pencil tests, performance assessments, self-repolt techniques, and peer appraisals are likely to be impractical or of limited use. Observational records of younger students are of value for still another reason. Because young cllildren tend to be more spontaneous and uninhibited in their actions, their behavior is often easier to observe and interpret.

One limitation of anecdotal records is the amount of time required to maintain an adequate system of records. Though this can be offset somewhat by limiting observations and repoIts, as suggested earlier, record keeping is still a time-consuming task. If teachers keep anecdotal records for their own use only, then they can work out a realistic plan by starting with a few anecdotes each day and gradually increasing it to a reasonable number. **If** the entire staff uses anecdotal records, then it is good to have all teacllers record as many anecdotes as is practical for a period of a few weeks followed by a staff meeting to discuss the recorded anecdotes and to decide what constitutes a reasonable number. **It** is generally unwise to set a specific number that must be recorded each week, but an approximate mirIimum can serve as a general guide.

Another serious limitation of anecdotal records is the difficulty of being objective when obselving and reporting student bellavior. Ideally, we would like a series of verbal snapshots that accurately represent the student's actual behavior. This goal is seldom attained, however, for teachers' own biases, hopes, and preconceived notions inevitably enter irIto their observations and reports. For example , they will tend to notice more desirable qualities in those students they like best and more undesirable qualities in those they like least. If they are assessing the effectiveness of a new teaching technique in which they have great faith, they may notice positive results and ignore the negative. If they believe that boys are less coordinated than girls, they will tend to perceive their performance skills as being of lower quality. Training in observation and reporting can reduce such distortions to a minimum, but they cannot be eradicated entirely. **In** strivirIg to elimirIate distortions, it is particularly important that teacllers be self-reflective about possible biases in their observations as the result of stereotypes and preconceptions about children on the basis of gender, race, ethnidty, or socioeconomic background. They must be 011 guard against self-fulfilling prophecies, especially in cases where immediate impressions lead to low expectations for irIdividual students.

A related difficulty is obtaining an adequate sample of behavior. When panicipating in class discussion, some students may be so tense and anxious that they appear cold and unfriendly toward others and their ideas seem disorganized. When observed in less formal settings, however, such as in the laboratory or on the playground, their behavior might be quite different. Similarly, a student may appear highly motivated and interested in mathematics class but bored and uninterested during English literature; or a student may be attentive and inquisitive in sdence one day and apathetic the next. Evelyone's behavior fluctuates somewhat from situation to situation and from one time to another. Therefore, to gain a reliable picUire of a typical pattern of behavior, we need to observe sUidents over a period of time and in a variety of situations. This also implies that general interpretations and recommendations concerning a student's adjustment should be delayed until a fairly adequate sample of behavior is obtained .

##### **Effective Use of Anecdotal Records**

In the previous chapters, we stated or implied a number of ways to improve procedures for observing and reponing student behavior. These and other points are listed here as suggestions for the effective use of anecdotal records.

1. Determine in advance what to observe, but be alert for unusual behavior. We are more apt to select and record meaningful inddents if we review objectives and outcomes and decide whicl1 behaviors require assessment by direct observation, that is, those that cannot be effectively assessed by other means. We can further focus our obselvations by looking for just a few types of behavior at any given time. Although such directed observations are valuable for obtaining evidence of sUident learning, there is always the danger that unique inddents that have special value for understanding a student's development will be overlooked. Consequently, we must be flexible enough to notice and repolt any unusual behavior in the event that it may be significant.

2. Analyze observational records for possible sources of bias. We should carefully review our initial impressions of each student. We need to consider the possibility that they are influenced by stereotypes based on gender, race, or ethnicity. We can minimize bias by reflecting on these and other factors that may bias ollr observations. Distinguishing between what is actually observed and the interpretation of that observation can be espedally useful in that regard. We should consider, for example, how the same recorded observation might have led to a different interpretation if it had been another student. Different interpretations of the same recorded observation may, of course, be appropriate if they are based on knowledge of different patterns of behavior for two students; but variation in interpretation should not be a consequence of preconceptions based on gender, race, ethnicity, or social background.

3. Observe and record enough of the situation to make the behavior meaningful. It is difficult to interpret behavior apart from the sinlation in which it occurred. An aggreSSive action, such as pushing another child, might reflect good-natured fun, an attempt to get attention, a response to direct provocation, or a sign of extreme hostility. Clues to the meaning of behavior frequently car! be obtained by directing attention to the actions of the other students involved and the palticular setting in which the behavior took place.

The record, therefore, should contain a rich enough description of those conditions that seem necessary for understanding the su,dent's behavior.

4. Make a record of the incident as soon after the observation as possible. In most cases, it is infeasible to write a deso'iption of an incident when it occurs. However, the longer we delay in recording observations, the greater the likelihood that important details will be forgotten. Try to make a few brief notes at oppomme times following behavioral incidents and complete the records as soon as possible after the incident.

5. Limit each anecdote to a bLief description of a single incident. Brief and concise descriptions take less time to write and less time to read and are more easily summarized. Just enough detail should be included to make the description meaningful and accurate. Limiting each description to a single incident also simplifies the task of writing, using, and interpreting the records (see the "Guidelines" box).

6. Keep the factual description of the incident and your interpretation of it separate. The deso'iption of an incident should be as accurate and objective as you can make it. This means stating exactly what happened in clear, nonjudgmental words. Avoid such terms as *unhappy, shy, hostile, sad, ambitious, persistent,* and tl1e like. If used at all, reserve such words for the separate section in whicl1 you give your tentative interpretations of the incident. There is no need to interpret each incident, but when interpretations are given, they should be kept separate and labeled as such.

7. Record both positive and negative behavioral incidents. Teachers are often more apt to notice those behaviors that disturb them personally and that intelfere with the process in the classroom. The result is that anecdotal records frequently contain a disproporionate number of the incidents that indicate the lack of learning or development.  For assessment purposes, it is equally important to record the less dramatic incidents that provide clues concerning the growth tl1at is taking place. Thus, a conscious effort should be made to observe and record subtle positive behaviors as well as the more obvious negative reactions.

8. Collect a number of anecdotes on a student before drawing inferences concerning typical behavior. A single behaviora1 incident is seldom very meaningful in understanding a student's behavior. We all have our moments of peak performance and extreme enol' proneness, elation and despair, and confidence and self-doubt. It is only after observing a student a number of times in a variety of settings that the basic pattern of behavior begins to emerge. Consequently, we should generally delay making any judgments concerning learning or development until we have a sufficient sample of behavior to provide a reliable picture of how the student typically behaves in different situations.

9. Obtain practice in writing anecdotal records. At first most teachers have considerable difficulty selecting significant incidents, observing them accurately, and describing them objectively. It is wise to start by recording just a few records each day rather than attempting too much. It might be wise to start by observing students' study habits during recess or during a study period" as this will allow sufficient time to observe and record significant behavior. A review of the usefulness of records kept over a period of a month or two can help hone the skills distinguishing between incidents that yield useful information and ones that do not. A review can also help in refining the nature and efficiency of the notes that are recorded.

GUIDELINES 
**Writing Anecdotal Records**

- Write brief, specific desQÂ·iptions.
- Include a condse description of what the student said or did and the situation in which it occurred. (Example: On the playground today, Debbie and Kim were choosing sides for softball. Michelle said, "I want to be on Debbie's team and play first base, or I won't play.")
- Do not write generalized descriptive anecdotes. These describe the behavior in general terms, as being typical of the student. (Example: On the playground

today, Michelle again showed that she always wants her own way.)

- Do not write evaluative anecdotes. These judge the behavior as acceptable or unacceptable, good or bad. (Example: Michelle was selfish and disruptive on the playground today.)
- Do not write interpretive anecdotes. These explain the reasons for the behaVior, usually in terms of a single general cause. (Example: Michelle can't play well with others because she is an overprotected, only child.)

#### **STUDENT JUDGMENTS AND REPORTS**

Teachers' observations and judgments of student behavior are of special value in those areas in which the behavior is readily observable and the teachers have spedal competence to judge. In assessing the ability to conduct and interpret experimental data , the effectiveness of an essay, or the quality of handwriting, for example, the teacher is unquestionably in the best position to make the judgment. The procedure or the product resulting from the procedure can be directly observed, and the teacher's knowledge in the area contributes to the validity and reliability of the judgments. In certain areas of student development, however, the teacl1er's assessment of behavior is apt to be inadequate unless observations are supplemented and complemented by the students' judgments and reports.

Various aspects of personal-sodal development can be more effectively assessed by including peer ratings and other peer appraisal methods in the assessment program. In the realms of leadership ability, concern for others, effectiveness in group work, and social acceptability, for example, students often know better than the teacher one another's strengths and weaknesses. The intimate interactions that occur among peers are seldom fully visible to an outside observer. Some differences between teacher judgment and peer judgment also can be expected because each is using diffe rent standards. Children's criteria of social acceptability, for example, are apt to be quite different from teachers' a-iteria.

Self-report techniques are also a valuable adjunct to the teacher's observations of behavior. A complete picture of students' adjustments, interests, and attitudes cannot be obtained without reports from them. Their expressed feelings and beliefs in d1ese areas

are at least as important as evidence obtained from observing their behavior. Although expressed feelings and observable behavior do not always completely agree, the self-report provides valuable evidence concerning the students' perceptions of themselves and how they want others to view them. In fact, a discrepancy between reported feelings and actual behavior is, in itself, significant assessment information.

Though peer appraisal and self-report techniques are useful for understanding students bener and gU iding their learning, development, and adjustment, the results should not be used for marking and reporting or in any manner that interferes with honest responses. The students must be convinced that it is in their own best interests to respond as accurately and frankly as possible. Teachers who have good relations with their students and who have consistently emphasized the positive values of the assessment information should have no difficulty obtaining the students' cooperation in these techniques. When only group results are needed, the students can, of course, respond anonymously.

#### **PEER APPRAISAL**

In some instances, it is possible to have students rate their peers on the same rating device used by the teacher. At the conclusion of a student's oral report before the class, for example , the other students could rate the performance on a standard rating form. The average of these ratings is a good indication of how the group felt about the student'S performance. Except for oral repotts, speeches, demonstrations, and similar situations in which one individual performs at a time, however, the usual rating procedures are seldom feasible with students. If we ask students to rate their classmates on a series of personal-social characteristics, eacll student will be required to fill out 30 or more rating forms. This becomes so cumbersome and time consuming that we can hardly expect the ratings to be diligently made. When peer ratings and other methods of peer appraisal are used, we must depend on greatly simplified procedures. Some of the techniques are so simple that they can be used effectively with students at the primary school level. The guess-who technique is an example of this type of measure.

##### **Guess-Who Technique**

One of the simplest methods of obtaining peer judgments is by means of the guess-who technique. With this procedure, each student is presented witll a series of brief behavior deso'iptions and asked to name those students who best fit each description. The desO"iptions may be limited to positive characteristics, or they may also include negative behaviors. The following items, taken from a form for assessing sociability, are typical of the types of positive and negative descriptions used.

- 1. Here is someone who is always friendly.
- 2. Here is someone who is never friendly.

Some teachers prefer to use only the positive behavior desO"iptions because of the possible hannful effects of negative nominations on group morale. Teachers must make this decision for tllemselves, however, because tlley are tlle only ones who can determine what the effects might be on their students. When good relations have been established among students and between teacher and students, this is not likely to be a problem.

When in doubt, however, it is usually better to sacrifice part of the assessment data than to disrupt the morale of the class.

In naming persons for each behavior description, the students are usually permitted to name as few or as many as they wish. Directions and sample items from a form for assessing concem for others are shown in Figure 13.2. The directions and behavior desoÂ·iptions must, of course, be adapted to the students' age level. With very young students, the technique can be presented as a guessing game, with the items stated as follows: "Here is someone who talks a lot-guess who?" When the technique is used with older students, the guess-who aspect is dropped, and the students are merely told to write the names of those who best fit each behavior description.

The guess-who teclmique is based on the nomination method of obtaining peer ratings and is scored by simply counting the number of mentions each student receives on each description. If both positive and negative descriptions are used, such as friendly and unfriendly, the number of negative mentions on eacll cllaracteristic is subtracted from the number of positive mentions. For example, 12 mentions as being friendly and 2 mentions of being unfriendly would result in a score of 10 on friendliness. The pattem of scores indicates eacll student's reputation in the peer group. This may not completely

In fact, one of the great values of this type of peer appraisal is that it makes the teacher aware of feelings and attitudes among students that were undetectable through direct observation.

Tllis nominating method can be used to assess any aspect of pels(mal-sodal development that students have had an adequate opportunity to observe. It is especially valuable for appraising personality characteristics, character traits, and social skills, but it is not limited to these areas. It is also useful in such areas as creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. As with other assessment techniques, the items used in any particular guess-who form should be derived directly from the objectives to be assessed .

The items shown in Figure 13.3 were used to assess problem solving at t11e elementalY sd1001 level and were derived directly from t11e stated objectives. More elaborate statements would, of course, be used at higher grade levels.

The main advantage of the guess-who teclmique is its usability. It can be administered in a relatively few minutes to students of all age levels, and scoring is a simple matter of counting t11e number of nominations received. Its main limitation is the lack of information it provides on the shy, witl1drawn student. Such students are frequently overlooked when nomination methods are used. In effect, they have no reputation in their peer group and are simply ignored during the rating process.

#### **SELF-REPORT TECHNIQUES**

The oldest and best-known method of obtaining information d irectly from an individual is the personal interview. The face-to-face contact has several advantages as a self-report procedure. First, it is flexible. Interviewers can clarify questions, pursue promising lines of inquiry, and give the interviewees an opportunity to qualify or expand on their answers. Second, interviewers can observe interviewees, noting the amount of feeling attached to their answers, the topiCS on which t11ey seem to be evasive, and the areas in which t11ey

are most expansive. Third, the interview makes possible not only collecting information from interviewees but also sharing information with them and, as in the counseling interview, using the face-to-face contact as a basis for therapy.

The personal interview would be an almost ideal method of obtaining self-rep0l1 information from students except for two serious problems. It is e),."tremely time consuming, and the infonnation gained is not standard from one person to another. Therefore, in the interests of both feasibility and greater comparability of results, the self-report inventOIY or questionnaire is commonly used in place of the personal interview. An inventory consists of a standard set of questions pel1aining to some particular area of behavior, administered and scored under standard conditions. It is a *SOI1* of standardized, written intelview that enables the collection of a large amount of information quickly and that provides an objective sununaq of the data collected.

The effective use of self-repol1 inventories assumes that individuals are both willing and able to report accurately. Responses can usually be easily faked if individuals want to present a distol1ed picture of themselves. Even when they want to be truthful, their recollections of past events may be inaccurate and their self-perceptions biased. These linlitations can be partly offset by using self-repol1 inventories only when students have little reason for faking, by emphasizing the value of frank responses for selfunderstanding and self-improvement, and by taking into account the possible presence of distortion when interpreting tile results. When these inventories are used for assessing affective behavior in the classroom, it may be wise to have the students respond anonymously.

#### **ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT**

One of the areas in which self-repOlt inventories are velY useful in the classroom is attitude measurement. In some instances, attitudes may be important instructional outcomes in their own right (e.g., scientific attimde). In other cases, we may wish to obtain measures of suldents' attitudes toward certain classroom activities, the textbook, laboratory experiences, or our own instruction so that needed adjustments can be made. Some information concerning attitudes can, of course, be discovered by observation, but a more complete assessment requires tllat observation be supplemented by reports of the students' feelings and opinions.

A simple self-report device for measuring attitude is listing the activities or statements the students are expected to respond to and tllen devising some simple means of responding. The teacher-made form for measuring att.itude toward matllematics activities at the lower primalY level shown in Figure 13.4 illustrates th.is type of self-report form. The directions can be given orally and repeated for each activity as follows: "Put an X in the box under tile face that tells how you feel about counting."

Another simple and widely used self-repolt method for measuring attitude is to list clearly favorable or unfavorable attimde statements and to ask tile smdents to respond to each statement on tile following 5-point scale: *sh-ong/y agree (SA), agree (A), undecided* (W, *disagree (D),* and *sh'ong/y disagree (SD).* This is called a *Liken scale,* named after its originator, and it is easily constnlcted and scored. The constnlction involves the following steps.

Figure 13.4

Teacher-made form for measuring attitude toward mathematics activities at the lower primary level

- 1. Write a series of statements expressing positive and negative opmJons toward some attitude object. For example, in preparing a scale to measure attitude toward school, a number of items such as the following might be written.
	- Scl100l is exciting.
	- School is a waste of time.

To get a measure of student self-concept in mathematics, items such as the following might be used:

- I am good at solving mathematics problems.
- I usually cannot solve a new mathematics problem.

A good pool of such items can be obtained by having the students in your class each write several positive and negative statements.

- 2. Select the best statements (at least 10), with a balance of positive and negative opinions and edit as needed.
- 3. List the statements, mixing up the positive and negative, and put the letters of the 5-point scale *(SA, A, U, D, SD)* to the left of each statement for easy marking. For students at the elementary level, it might be best to list tile 5 points in multiple-choice fashion with the words written out (e.g., *strongly agree).*
- 4. Add the directions telling students how to mark their answers and include a key at the top of the page if letters are used for each statement *(SA, A, U, D, SD).*
- 5. Some prefer to drop tile *undecided* category so that respondents will be forced to show agreement or disagreement. Others have expanded the scale by adding the categories *slightly agree* and *slightly disagree.* Although such cl1anges might be useful for some purposes, tile 5-point scale is quite satisfactory for most uses.

A Likert scale for measuring attitude toward a science course is shown in Figure 13.5. By lengdlening tile instrument and preparing separate scales, it is possible to obtain a more detailed measure of attitude toward specific palts of d1e course (e.g., textbook, visual aids, tests, or laboratOlY work). Our example here simply shows d1e procedure and format.

The scoring of a Likert scale is based on assigning weights from 1 to 5 for each position on d1e scale. Favorable statements such as item 1 in Figure 13.5 are weighted 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, going from *SA* to *SD.* Unfavorable statements such as item 2 in Figure 13.5 have these weights reversed. Thus, mey are weighted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, going from *SA* to *SD.* An individual's total score on this type of scale is me sum of the scores on all items, wim the higher score indicating a more favorable attitude.

In using attitude scales such as the one in Figure 13.5, it is usually best to ask for anonymous responses. This will indicate how the students in class feel about me course and, if separate scales are used, how mey view me various activities in it. Such information is useful in making course revisions, and anonymous responses provide greater assurance that the replies will reflect me students' real feelings.

In interpreting the results of attitude scales, it is important to keep in mind that these are verbal expressions of feelings and opinions d1at individuals are willing to report. Good rapport wid1 the students and a sincere belief on their part that frank responses are in their own best interests will help produce valid responses. Even under the most ideal conditions, however, it is wise to supplement attitudes determined by self-report memods with evidence from orner sources. For example, if students have reported a favorable attitude toward orner ethnic groups, guess-who data can be used to detennine how

frequendy members of dlOse groups are chosen for classroom activities. Similarly, if favorable attitudes toward students with disabilities are repolted, this might be checked by observing how the students interact with students widl disabilities in the classroom.

##### **Published Attitude Scales**

Numerous published attitude scales are available for school use. An example is the Estes Attitude Scales (grades 3 through 12), designed to measure attitude toward school subjects. At the secondary level, the scales measure attitude toward English, mathematics, reading, science, and social studies. Specialized scales for topics such as attitudes toward computers are also available. See the ERiC/ ETS Test Locator Web site at http://ericae.neti testco1.htm to locate pUblished attitude scales.

#### **INTEREST INVENTORIES**

As with attitude measurement, information about students' interests can be gailiered from simple self-report devices prepared by the teacher. An interest inventolY for reading, for example, might be no more than a list of types of books with dle students asked to mark whether they like or dislike each type. An example of such an inventory is shown in Figure 13.6. A simpler version of iliis inventory could be developed for students at the primaly level by using broader categories (e.g., animals, people, and places).

Various medlods of responding can be used wiili informal interest inventories. The simple like-dislike response method can be expanded to more points, SUcll as *like, indifferent, dislike* or *strongly like, like, indifferent, dislike, strongly dislike.* When there are relatively few items to respond to, ilie SUI dents can rank iliem in order from *like most* to *like least,* as in the following example.

| Rmlk | Type of Reading |
|------|-----------------|
|      | Fiction         |
|      | Nonfiction      |
|      | Poetry          |
|      | Drama           |

A simple paired-comparison procedure also might be used to find out the students' reading preferences when dlere are relatively few items to respond to. Using dlese same four items, for example, we would have six pairs as follows:

| Fiction    | Drama         |
|------------|---------------|
| Nonfiction | Drama         |
| Fiction    | Nonfiction    |
| Poetry     | Drama         |
| Nonfiction | ___ Poetry |
| Poetry     | Fiction       |

Illustrative inventory for surveying reading interets

The students are instructed to mark the type of reading that they most prefer in each pair. A simple tally of the number of marks for each type of reading will indicate the students' relative preference.

Using any of the preceding response methods, we can obtain an interest score for each individual student, or we can combine the results for the entire class. Although students can fake responses to informal interest inventories, they seldom do. There are no right or wrong answers, and the results are usually used to plan classroom activities or to develop individual learning programs. In contrast with attitude scales, there is little reason to fear that one's responses to the inventory will influence grades.

##### Published Interest Inventories

There are a number of pUblished interest inventories, but most of them have been designed for use in educational and vocational gUidance. In some cases, however, the results can be used in planning more effective classroom instnlction. Low interest scores in art and music, for example, might suggest that special activities are needed in these areas. Similarly, when a number of students have low interest scores in such areas as computation and science, a review of classroom activities and materials may be helpful. As with informal interest inventories, an individual's pattern of interests also may be useful in selecting reading material and planning individual learning programs.

One interest inventOIY that has been widely used at the high school and college levels is the Strong Interest InventOIY (fonnerly known as the Strong-Campbell Interest

Inventory). This inventOlY consists of 291 items that are 5-point liken scales measuring interest in occupations, work and leisure activities, and educational subjects The main part of the Strong Interest InventOlY is scored and interpreted in terms of the similarity between an individual's expressed interests and those of persons engaged in particular occupations. The answers are placed on answer sheets or it can be taken on the Internet (available at http://www.cpp.comJ products/strong/index.asp). The results are printed out on a profile that contains 244 occupational scales, 30 basic interest scales, and 6 personal style scales.

Another interest inventory that is often used in high schools is the Self-Directed Search (SDS) Career Explorer developed by John Holland and Amy Powell (available at http://www.self-directed-search .com!). The SOS Career Explorer is designed for use by middle school and high school students. Results are reported using a three-letter code developed by Holland to highlight the three of six possible general occupational themes that are of greatest interest according to the student's responses. The six dimensions are called *(R) realistic,* (I) *investigative, (A) artistic, (S) social, (E) enterprising,* and *(C) conventionaL.* For example, a student with highest scores on the realistic, enterprising, and investigative dimensions would have the REI letter code. Occupations where people frequently have a given three-letter code can be identified.

As with other self-report techniques, responses to published interest inventories can be easily faked. This is seldom a problem, however, where the emphasis is on self-understanding and educational and vocational planning. Students are anxious to find out about their interests, and the inventOlies consist of items that tend to be psychologically nonthreatening.

The instability of students' interests dllling elementary and high school years suggests that we should use interest inventories with extreme caution at these levels. Interests typically are not stable until approximately age 17. This does not mean that we must wait until this age to meaSure interests but that our interpretations must be highly tentative. In one sense, d1e instability of interests among d1ildren and adolescents is highly encouraging, for it indicates that our efforts to broaden and develop interests d1rough school activities have some chance of succeeding. It is mainly when we are attempting to use them in career planning that stability poses a selious problem. For vocational deCisiOns, we should rely most heavily on interest measures obtained during the last 2 years of high sd1001 and later.

Another precaution to keep in mind is not to confuse interest scores with measures of ability. A strong interest in science, for example, mayor may not be accompanied by the verbal and numerical abilities needed to pursue successfully a course of study or a career in science. A scientific interest may be satisfied by collecting butterflies or by discovering a cure for cancer. Interest measures merely indicate whether an individual is apt to find satisfaction in a palticular type of activity. Measures of ability determine the level of activity at which the individual can expect to function effectively.

#### **PERSONALITY MEASURES**

Classroom assessments of students' personality characteristics and adjustment problems are probably best made through the use of anecdotal records, rating scales, and other observational and peer appraisal techniques. However, there are two types of personality measures that classroom teachers should know about: personality inventories and projective techniques. These are briefly described for general infonnation only. Using them effectively requires special training in counseling or clinical psychology.

##### **Personality Inventories**

The typical personality inventoty presents students with a series of questions like those used in a psychiatric screening interview. For example, an inventOlY might include items such as the following:

Do you daydream often? Are you frequently depressed? Do you have difficulty making friends? Do you usually feel tired?

Responses to such questions are commonly indicated by circling ye>, *no,* or ? (for uncertain). In some instances, a forced-choice procedure is used where the items are paired and the respondent must indicate which of the two statements is more characteristic of self.

Personality inventories vary considerably in the type of score provided. Some provide a single adjustment score, whereas others have separate scores for particular adjustment areas (e.g., healtll, social, or emotional) or for specific personality traits (e.g., self-confidence, sociability, or ascendancy). In general, research has not supported the validity of separate scores for assessing adjustment by means of inventories. Even using me total score for distinguishing between adjusted and maladjusted individuals is open to question.

All tlle limitations of the self-report technique tend to be accentuated. in tlle personality inventory. First, the replies can be easily faked, and the tllreatening nature of many of me questions encourages presenting a distOlted picture. Some inventories have "control keys" to detect faking, and others reduce faking by means of the forced-clloice procedure, but it cannot be entirely eliminated. Second, in addition to honesty, accurate responses reqUire good self-insight, but this is the velY characteristic that poorly adjusted individuals are apt to lack, as they are prone to excessive use of adjustment mechanisms that tend to distort their perceptions of themselves and tlleir relations with otllers. Finally, the ambiguity of items is also likely to distort the results.  Such questions as "Are you frequently depressed?" do not mean the same thing to all individuals. Although some ambiguity may be desirable in tllese inventories (as we are seeking perceptions ratller tllan facts), words such as *frequently* have SUcll a broad range of meanings mat enOl" is likely to be introduced. In addition to these technical shOltcomings, there is the invasion-of-privacy issue. Congressional investigators, parents, and others have raised the question of the school's right to ask students such personal questions. Primarily because of the invasion-of-privacy issue , the routine use of personality and adjustment inventories in Scllools has declined to near zero.

Psychologically trained counselors may find personality inventories useful for beginning counseling intelviews. The client can be asked to fill out the inventory early in the counseling session, and the response to individual items can serve as a starting point for discussion. Even if the responses are not completely frank or insightful, this can be dealt with in the counseling sessions. When used in this way, the inventory serves as an icebreaker. Invasion of privacy is not an issue here because the client has voluntarily sought out a relationship in which revelation of inner feelings is a known requisite for obtaining help.

##### **Projective Techniques**

Projective techniques are another method of assessing personal-social adjustment with which the classroom teacher should be familiar. Because they generally require clinical training to administer and interpret, it is not expected that teachers will use them directly. It is more than likely, however, that they will encounter some clinical reports of students that contain interpretations of projective test results.

**In** contrast with tlle highly structured personality inventOlY, projective techniques provide almost complete freedom of response. Typically, individuals are presented with a series of ambiguous forms or pictures and asked to describe what they see. Their responses are then analyzed to detennine what content and structure they have "projected" onto the ambiguous stimuli.

Two of the best-known projective techniques are the Rorschach inkblot test and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAD. The Rorschach test consists of 10 inkblot figures on cards. and the TAT includes a series of oictures. These tests are usually administered to , . , one individual at a time, and the individual's responses are recorded during the testing. Analysis of the results requires both systematic scoring and impressionistic interpretation, with emphasis on the total personality pattern revealed. Projective techniques are used primarily as part of a complete clinical study of t110se individuals who are experiencing adjustment difficulties.

#### **SUMMARY**

Observational techniques are especially useful in assessing performance skills and celtain aspects of personal-sodal development. In addition, observation supplements and complements paper-and-pendl testing and performance-based assessments by indicating how students typically behave in natural situations.

The least strucnlred observational technique is the anecdotal record: This is simply a method of recording factual descriptions of student behavior. To make anecdotal record keeping feasible , it is desirable to restrict observations at any given time to a few types of behavior or to a few students. Anecdotal records have the advantages of (a) describing behavior in natural settings, (b) highlighting evidence of exceptional behavior apt to be overlooked by other techniques, and (c) being usable with the very young. Their limitations are (a) the time and effort required to maintain an adequate record system, (b) t11e difficulty of writing objective descriptions of behaVior, and (c) the problem of obtaining an adequate sample of behavior. These disadvantages can

be minimized by following specific procedures for observing and recording the behavioral incidents. Suggestions for improving anecdotal records include (a) determining in advance what to observe , (b) analyzing observational records for possible sources of bias, (c) describing the setting in which the behavior occurred, (d) making the record as soon as possible after observing the behavior, (e) confining each anecdote to a single incident, (f) separating factual description from interpretation, (g) recording both positive and negative incidents, (h) collecting a number of anecdotes before drawing inferences, and (0 obtaining practice in observing and recording student behavior.

In some areas of learning and development, it is desirable to supplement the teacher's observations with infonnation obtained directly from the students. We can ask the students to rate or judge their peers and to report on their own feelings, thoughts, and past behavior. Several peer appraisal methods and self-report techniques have been developed for this purpose.

Peer appraisal is especially useful in assessing personality characteristics, social relations skills, and other fonns of typical behavior. The give-and-take of social interaction in the peer group provides students with a unique opportunity to observe and judge the behavior of their fellow students. Because these peer ratings are based on experiences that are seldom fully visible to adult observers, they are an important adjunct to teachers' observations.

Peer appraisal methods include the guess-who technique. This technique for obtaining peer ratings requires students to name those classmates who best fit each of a series of behavior descriptions. The number of nominations students receive on each characteristic indicates the ir reputation in the peer group. This nOminating procedure can be used to assess any aspect of behavior that is observable to fellow students. The results can be used to rearrange groups, to improve tlle social adjustment of individual students, and to assess the influence of school practices on students' social relations.

Self-repOlt techniques are used to obtain information that is inaccessible by other means, including reports on the student's attitudes, interests, and personal feelings. Such information can be obtained by means of a personal intelYiew, but a self-report inventory is more commonly used. The inventory is a sort of standardized written interview that produces comparable results from one person to another. The effective use of self-report tecl1I1iques assumes that the respondent is both willing and able to report accurately. Thus, special efforts must be made to ensure these conditions.

Attitude scales can be used to gather information concerning students' feelings and opinions toward various classroom activities, situations, groups, and special events. Interest inventories contribute to a better understanding of students' preferences and are useful in educational and vocational planning. Personality inventories and projective tecl1I1iques aid in assessing students' personal-social adjustment but are not recommended for use by me classroom teacher.

Both peer ratings and self-report inventories can provide useful information for understanding students better and for guiding their learning, development, and adjustment. These purposes are best served, however, when this information is combined with test results, obselYational data, and other information concerning the students.

### CHAPTER 14 : ASSEMBLING, ADMINISTERING, AND APPRAISING CLASSROOM TESTS AND ASSESSMENTS

Ware in preparing an assessment plan and constructing relevant test items and assessment tasks should be followed by similar care in reviewing and editing the items and tasks, preparing clear directions, and administering and appraising the results. Classroom assessments also can be improved by using simple methods to analyze student responses and by building a file of effective items and tasks.

Effective classroom assessment begins with an assessment plan that specifically describes the instructional objectives and content to be measured and the relative emphasis to be given to each intended learning outcome. This is followed by the selection of the most appropriate item and task formats (e.g., multiple choice, essay, or hands-on performance assessment) and the preparation of items and tasks that are relevant to the learning outcomes specified in the plan. These steps have received considerable attention in the preceding chapters because they are crucial to the validity of the assessment. The only way we can ensure that a classroom test will serve its intended purpose is to identify the learning outcomes we want to measure and then to construct test items and assessment tasks that call forth the specific performance described in the learning outcomes. We must also assemble the items and tasks, prepare directions, administer the instrument, score the student responses, and interpret and appraise the results.

Our goal throughout the preparation and use of classroom tests and assessments is to obtain valid evidence of student learning. In the final analysis, valid measurement of achievement is the product of a systematically controlled series of steps, beginning with the identification of instructional objectives and ending with the scoring and interpretation of results. Although validity is built in during the construction of the items and tasks, systematic procedures of assembly, administration, and scoring will provide greater assurance that the items and tasks will function as intended. Appraising the test items and assessment tasks after they have been administered can also help improve their quality. Procedures for analyzing student responses provide infonnation for evaluating the effectiveness of each item or task and for detecting weaknesses that should be corrected. This information is useful when reviewing the results with students, and it is indispensable when building a file of high-quality items and tasks for future use.

PerfOlmance-based assessments typically involve a relatively small number of tasks because each task requires a substantial amount of time. Thus, some of the issues addressed in this chapter apply more to classroom tests that involve a substantial number of items and/ or restricted response tasks. For example, if a single extended-response, performance-based task is to be administered, the issues of test assembly and some aspects of item analysis are not relevant. Hence, in this c1upter we focus on classroom tests with a substantial number of items and make note where the same or related considerations apply to performance-based assessments.

#### **ASSEMBLING THE CLASSROOM TEST**

The preparation of items for use in a test is greatly fadlitated if the items are properly recorded, if they are written at least several days before they are to be used, and if extra items are constructed.

##### **RecordinTest Items

When constructing the test items, it is desirable to write each one in a form that makes it possible to easily address and rettieve individual items. The items may be wtitten into a word-processing program or onto index cards. In addition to the test item, the item record should contain inforn1ation concerning the instructional objective, the specific learning outcome, and the content measured by the item. A space should also be reserved for item-analysis information to allow room to record the data each time the item is used. An example of this type of infonnational record is presented later in the chapter in relationship to the discussion of item analysis (Figure 14.2).

Item records, whether in the form of separate sheets in a standard word-processing system or physical cards, provide flexibility. As the items are reviewed and edited, they can be eliminated, added, or revised with little difficulty. The same holds true when arranging the items for the test: They can be arranged and rearranged merely by sorting the records. Th felxiblity of this recording system also makes it esy to add the items to a computer item bank. Specialized software for item writing and item banks is available, but functions of maintaining a bank of items can also be readily handled by a standard word-processing system.

##### **Reviewing Test Items and Assessment Tasks**

No matter how carefully items or tasks have been prepared, defects inadveltently creep in during construction. As we concentrate on the clarity and conciseness of a question, a

verbal clue slips in unnoticed. Ai; we attempt to construct more c11allenging items, we unwittingly introduce some ambiguity. As we rework a multiple-choice item to make the incorrect choices more plausible, the behavior called forth by the item is unintentionally modified. As we attempt to inaÂ·ease the authenticity of a task for problems faced outside the classroom, we introduce unintended reliance on access to resources that put students from families with linlited resources at an unfair disadvantage. In shOlt, we focus so closely on some aspects of item or task construction that we overlook others. This results in an accumulation of unwanted errors that may distott the function of the item or task. Such technical defects can be most easily detected by (a) reviewing the items and tasks after they have been set aside for a few days, and (b) asking a fellow teacher to review and criticize them.

In reviewing test items and tasks, we should tly to view them from the student's perspective as well as from that of the teacher. From these two vantage points, each item or task should be read carefully and its effectiveness judged. The following questions will help you analyze the quality of each item or task.

1. Is the fonnat appropriate for the learning outcome being measured? If the learning outcome calls for the defmition of a term, for example, then a supply-type item (e.g., shottanswer item) would be appropriate and a selection-type item (e.g., mUltiple choice) would be clearly inappropriate. If the learning outcome calls for the ability to collect, organize, integrate, and present information in the form of a coherent argument, then nothing shOlt of a perfonnance-based task will suffice. On the other hand, if the intended outcome was simply the identification of the correct definition, then a selection-type item would be aneollate. Thus. the first steo is to check whether the format is sllitahle for the rvoe of .---, .. ----. -----1 - -- ----- - --r -- -- ------- -- ------ --- - - ---- -\_ . -- -----.- -- - - - ---- -Jr - - student perfonnance described in the testing and assessment plan. The action verb in the statement of each specific learning outcome (e.g. , *defines, desCribes, identifies)* indicates which item format is more appropriate.

2. Does the knowledge, lmderstanding, or thinking skill called forth by the item or task match the specific learning outcome and subject-matter content being measured? When a table of specifications has been used as a basis for constructing items and tasks, this is merely a matter of checking to see whether the item or task is still relevant to the same cell in the table. If, for example, an item's functioning content has shifted during construction, the item should be either modified so that it serves its original purpose or reclassified in light of the new purpose. In any case, the response called foith by an item or task should agree with the purpose for which it is to be used.

3. Is the point of the item or task clear? A careful review of items and tasks often reveals ambigUity, inappropriate vocabulary, and awkward sentence structure that were overlooked during their construction. Returning to items and tasks after they have been set aside for a few days provides a fresh outlook that makes such defects more apparent. The difficulty of tile vocabulary and the complexity of tl1e sentence structure must, of course, be judged in terms of the students' maturity level. At all levels, however, ambiguity should be removed. In its final form, each item or task should be so clearly worded that all students understand its meaning. The quality of student responses should be detennined solely by whether tl1ey possess tl1e knowledge, understanding, or skill being measured.

4. Is the item or task free from excessive verbiage? Often, items become excessively wordy because of awkward sentence structure or the inclusion of nonfunctional material. Some teacllers justify the use of an item by including a statement or two concerning the problem's importance. Others expand a simple question into an elaborate story simation to make the item more interesting. Although adding such nonfunctional material may be useful in some instances, items and tasks are generally more effective when the problem is stated as concisely as possible. When reviewing items, the content of eacll item should be analyzed to determine the functional elements leading to the cooÂ·ect response. If there are any elements that the students may disregard entirely and still respond conectly, they probably should be removed. See the "Guidelines" box.

5. Does the item have an answer that would be agreed on by ex pelts? How well would experts agree about the degree of excellence of task performances? This is seldom a problem with facmal material, which usually can be judged as cooÂ·ect or inconect. It is more of a problem with selection-type items that ask for the best reason, the best method, or the best interpretation. The problem is greatest with tasks requiring extended performances where qualified judges may differ in their evaluation of performances. If experts agree on the best response, fine, but do not include items that require students to endorse someone's unsupported opinion (even if it happens to be yours), and do not evaluate perfonnances on tasks simply in terms of your personal preferences.

6. Is the item or task free from technical errors and irrelevant clues? The checklists for reviewing eacll of the item types presented in Cha pters 7 through 11, list points to consider in searching out technical elTors and ilTelevant clues. As noted earlier, an irrelevant clue for a selection-type item is any element that leads the poor achiever to the correa answer and thereby prevents the item from functioning as intended. These include (a) grammatical inconsistencies, Cb) verbal associations, Cc) spedfic detemliners (e.g., words such as *always*  and *never),* and Cd) some mecl1anical features, such as conect statements tending to be longer than incorrect ones. Most of these clues can be removed merely by trying to detect them during the item review. They somehow seem more obvious after the items have been set aside for a while.

7. Is the item or task free from raCial, ethnic, and gender bias? A final check should be made to make certain that the vocabulary and problem situation in each item or task would be acceptable to the members of all groups and would have a similar meaning to them. An effort should be made to remove any type of stereotyping, such as always pOltraying minorities in subservient roles, women in homemaking roles, and the like. A judicious and balanced use of different roles for minorities and males and females should contribute to more effective assessment.

When possible, it can be useful to get fellow teachers to review your test items and assessment tasks. With right- wrong or best-answer items, they should be asked to read each item, indicate the answer, and note any technical defects. If an answer does not agree with the key, it may be because the question is ambiguous. Asking another teacher to "think out loud" when deciding on the answer will usually reveal the misinterpretation of the question and the source of the ambiguity. For perfonnance tasks requiring extended

responses, reviewers identify the nature of the performances that they would expect and the qualities they would look for in evaluating the performances as well as possible defects in the task itself. This is how other persons can be most useful. Reviewers will be less helpful in evaluating the types of responses called forth by the items because this requires a knowledge of what the students have been taught. Only the teacher who prepared the item or task knows for sure whether it is likely to measure understanding or merely the recall of a previously learned response.

When items or tasks have been revised and those to be included in the test or assessment have been tentatively selected, ask the following questions.

- 1. Does the set of items and tasks measure a representative sample of the learning outcomes and course content included in the assessment plan?
- 2. Are there enough items or tasks for each interpretation to be made?
- 3. Is the difficulty of the items and tasks appropriate for the measurement purpose and for the students for whom the test or assessment is intended?
- 4. Are the test items free from overlapping so that the information in one does not provide a clue to the answer in another?

The first question can be answered by comparing the final selection of items and tasks with the table of specifications or other assessment plan. Answers to the last three are detennined by reviewing the items and tasks in eacll content area and as a total set. Affirmative answers to these questions mean the items and tasks are ready to be assembled for administration. See the box "Review of Test Items Selected from Item Banks" for guidelines on selecting items from published sources.

##### **Arranging Items in the Test**

There are various methods of grouping items in an acllievenlent test, and the method will Vaty somewhat depending on the use of the results. For most classroom purposes, the items can be arranged by a systematic consideration of (a) the types of items used, (b) the learning outcomes measured, (c) the difficulty of the items, and Cd) the subject matter measured.

First, the items should be arranged in sections by item type. That is, all true-false items should be grouped together, then all matching items, then all multiple choice items and so on. This arrangement requires the fewest sets of directions, it is the easiest for the students because they can retain the same mental set throughout each section, and it greatly facilitates scoring. When two or more item types are included in a test, there is also some advantage in keeping the simpler item types together and placing the more complex ones in the test, as follows:

- 1. True-false or alternative-response items
- 2. Matching items
- 3. Sholt-answer items
- 4. Multiple-choice items
- 5. Interpretive exercises
- 6. Restricted-response essay questions
- 7. Restricted-response performance tasks

Extended-response essay questions and performance tasks usually take enough time that they would be administered alone. If combined with some of the other types of items and tasks listed previously, the extended-response tasks should come last. It is not expected that all item types will appear in the satne test. Seldom are more than a few types used, but this is the general order.

Arranging the sections of the test in this order produces a sequence that roughly approximates the complexity of the learning outcomes measured, ranging from the simple to the complex. It is then merely a matter of grouping the items within each item type. For this purpose, items that measure similar outcomes should be placed together and then

##### Review afTest Items Selected from Item Banks

Test items selected from workbooks, teacher guides, instmctor manuals, and item banks are seldom appropriate for use without modification. Thus, before they are used in a classroom test, they should be screened and modified to fit the local instructional program. Both the checklists for reviewing test items and tasks, presemed in Chapters 7

through 11, and the list of review questions in this chapter are guides for this purpose. Our aim when selecting items for classroom use should be the same as when constructing them. We want the items to be both technically sound and relevant to what has been taught during the insrruction.

arranged in order of ascending difficulty. For example, the items in the multiple-choice section might be arranged in the following order: (a) knowledge of terms, (b) knowledge of spedfic facts, (c) knowledge of principles, and (d) application of principles. Keeping together items that measure similar outcomes is especially helpful in detemlining the types of learning outcomes causing students the greatest difficulty.

If, for any reason, it is not feasible to group the items by the learning outcomes measured, then it is still desirable to anange them in order of increasing difficulty. Beginning with the easiest items and proceeding gradually to the most difficult has a motivating effect on students. Also, encountering difficult items early in the test often causes students to spend a disproportionate amount of time on such items. If the test is long, they may be forced to omit later questions that they could easily have answered.

With the items ciassified by item type, the sections of the test and the items within each section can be arranged in order of increasing difficulty. Some shifts in the first four item types may be warranted by the difficulty of the items used, but the interpretive exercises and essay items certainly should be last.

In constructing classroom achievement tests, there is little to be gained by grouping test items according to content. When it appears desirable to do *so,* such as in separating historical periods, these divisions should be kept to a minimum.

Extended-response essay questions, by their very nature, require separate administration. Performance-based tasks or oral presentations requiring extended time or access to such resources as the libraty, laboratory eqUipment, or a computer for construction of a response also obviously need to be assigned as separate units rather than as patt of a classroom test.

To summarize, the most effective method for organizing items in the typical classroom test is to (a) form sections by item type, (b) group the items within each section by the learning outcomes measured, and (c) arrange both the sections and the items within sections in an ascending order of difficulty. Use subject-matter groupings only when needed for some specific purpose.

##### **Preparing Directions for the Test or Assessment**

Teacllers sometimes devote considerable time and attention to the construction and assembly of test items or a cllaUenging performance-based assessment and then dash off directions with very little thought. In fact, many teachers include no written directions with their tests, assuming either that the items are self-explanatory or that the students are

conditioned to answering the types of items used in the test. Some teachers also use oral directions, but they frequently leave much to be desired. Whether written, oral, or both, the directions should include at least the following points (see Gronlund, 2005).

- 1. Purpose of the test or assessment
- 2. Time allowed for completing the test or performing the task
- 3. Directions for responding
- 4. How to record the answers
- 5. What to do about guessing for selection-type test items
- 6. The basis for scoring open-ended or extended responses

The amount of detail for eacll of these points depends mainly on the students' age level, the comprehensiveness of the test or assessment, the complexity of the items or tasks, and the students' experience with the testing or assessment procedure used. Using new item types and separate answer sheets, for example, requires much more detailed directions than do familiar items requiring students merely to circle or underline the answer.

Purpose of the Test or Assessment. The purpose of the test or assessment is usually indicated when the test is announced or at the beginning of the semester when the evaluation procedures are described as a patt of the general orientation to the course. Should there be any doubt whether the purpose is clear to all students, however, it could be explained again at the time of testing or assessment. This is usually done orally. The only time a statement of the purpose of the test or assessment needs to be included in the written directions is when it is to be administered to several sections taught by different teachers then a written statement of purpose ensures greater uniformity.

Time Allowed for Completing the Test or Performing tbe Task. It is helpful to tell the students how much time they will have for the whole test or performance task and how to distribute their time among the patts. When essay questions are included, it is also good to indicate approximately how much time should be allotted to each question. This enables the students to use their time most effectively and prevents less able students from spending too much time on questions that are palticularly difficult for them.

Classroom tests or assessments of achievement should generally have liberal time allowances. With a few exceptions, such as measures of fluency or special computational skills, speed is not important. OUr main concern is the level of achievement each student has attained. Were it not for practical considerations like the length of class periods and the pressure of other school activities, there would be no need for any time limits with most classroom achievement tests or assessment tasks.

Judging the amount of time that students will need to complete a given test or assessment task is not simple. It depends on the types of items and tasks used, the age and ability of the students, and the complexity of the learning outcomes measured . As a rough gUide, the average high scllool student should be able to answer two true-false items, one multiple-choice item, or one shott-answer item per minute of testing time. Interpretive test items take much more time; the exact amount depends on the length and complexity of the introductory materials. The time required for essay questions and other perfonnance-based assessment tasks can vary anywhere from a few minutes each to several class periods. Also, elementaty scl1001 students generally reqUire more time per

item than high school students, and reading skill is an important determiner of the amount of time needed by a specific group. Experienced teachers familiar with the ability and work habits of a given group of students are in the best position to judge time allotments. It is better to err in the direction of allotting too much time than to deprive some of the slower students from demonstrating their maximum levels of achievement.

Directions for Responding. The directions for each section of the test should indicate the basis for selecting or supplying the answers. With true-false, matching, and multiplechoice items, this part of the directions can be relatively simple. For example, the statement, "Select the choice that best completes the statement or answers the question" might be sufficient for multiple-choice items. When interpretive exercises are used, however, more detailed directions are necessary because the basis for the response is much more complex. The directions must clearly indicate the type of interpretation expected. As stated in Chapter 9, each interpretive exercise usually requires its own directions.

It is sometimes good to include sample test items correctly marked so that students can check their understanding of the basis for answering. This practice is especially helpful to elementary school students and to students at other levels when complex item types are used.

As noted earlier, essay questions and other performance-based assessment tasks frequently require special directions concerning the type of response expected. If the selection and organization of ideas are emphasized, for example, this should be indicated to the students so that they have a more adequate basis for responding.

Procedure for Recording Answers may be recorded on the test form itself or on separate answer sheets. If the test is short, the number of students taking the test is small, or the students are relatively young, then answers are generally recorded directly on the test paper. For most other situations, separate answer sheets are preferred because they reduce the time needed for scoring, and they make it possible to use the test papers over again. The latter feature is especially useful when the test is to be given to students in different sections of the same course.

Directions for recording the answer on the test paper itself can be relatively simple. With selection items, it is merely a matter of instructing the students to circle, underline, or check the letter indicating the correct answer. For students in the primary grades, it is usually better to ask them to mark the answer directly by drawing a line under it. With supply items, the directions should indicate where to put the answer and the units in which it is to be expressed if the answer is numerical.

Separate answer sheets are easily constructed, and the directions for their use can be placed on the test paper or on the answer sheet itself. A common type of teacher-made sheet is shown in Figure 14.1. The directions on this sheet are rather general, as they must cover instructions for recording various types of answers. Students are instructed to cross out rather than circle the letters indicating the correct answers to facilitate scoring with a stencil key. Circled letters cannot be readily seen through holes in a stencil.

Special answer sheets for machine scoring can be used with classroom tests, but there is no advantage in using them unless machine scoring facilities are readily available and the number of papers to be scored warrants the expense. When machine scoring is used, special directions should be obtained from the company supplying the scoring service.

| _______ Course _______ Section | _____________ Name _ _ _______ Date _ __ |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| _______ Test _______                    | Score: Part I ______                                          |

Directions: Read all directions on the test paper carefully and follow them exactly. For each test item, indicate your answer on this sheet by crossing out the appropriate letter (X) or filling in the appropriate blank. Be sure that the number on the answer sheet is the same as the number of the test item your are answering.

What to DOAbout Guessing for Selection-Type Hems. When selection-type items are used, the directions should tell students what to do when they are uncertain of the answer. Should they guess or omit the item? If no instrllctions are given on this pOint, the bold students will guess freely, whereas others will answer only those items of which they are fairly celtain. The bold students will select some correct answers just by lucky guesses, and thus their scores will be higher than they should be. On the other hand, if the students are instructed "Do not guess" or "Answer only those items of which you are celtain," the more timid students will omit many items they could answer correctly. Such students are not very celtain about anytlling, which prevents them from responding even when they are reasonably sure of the answers. With these directions, the bold students will continue to guess, although possibly not quite so wildly.

As Cronbach (1990) pointed out, the tendency to guess or not to guess when in doubt about an item is determined by personality factors and cannot be entirely eliminated by directions that caution against guessing or that promise penalties to those who do guess. The only way to eliminate variations in the tendency to guess is to instruct students to answer every item. When tllis is done, no student is given a special advantage, and it is unnecessary to correct for guessing in tlle scoring. Directions such as the following are usually sufficient to communicate this to the students: "Because your score is tlle number right, be sure to answer every item. "

Some teachers object to such directions on the grounds that encouraging guessing is undesirable from an educational standpoint. Most responses to doubtful items are not wild guesses, however, but are guided by some information and understanding. In this respect,

they are not too different from the infonned guesses we make when we predict weather, judge the possible consequences of a decision, or choose one course of action over another. Problem solving always involves a celtain amount of this type of informed guessing.

A more defensible objection to directions that encourage guessing is that the chance en'ors introduced into the test scores lower the accuracy of measurement. Although this is certainly objectionable, it probably has less influence on the validity of the results than does the systematic advantage given to the bold guessers by the "do not guess" directions.

For liberally timed classroom tests, the "answer every item" directions are favored. For speed tests and when teachers want to discourage guessing, however, directions such as the following are a good compromise: "Answer all items for which you can find some reasonable basis for answering, even though you are not completely sure of the answer. Do not guess wildly, though, because there will be a correction for guessing."

The Basis for coring Open-Ended or Extended Responses. For tasks requiring extended or open-ended written responses, it is important to tell students the basis for scoring. If there are several essay questions, for example, the number of points possible for the response to each question should be indicated. The impoltance attached to factors such as factual accuracy, organization, comprehensiveness, persuasiveness, and originality can be indicated. Students should also be informed if their responses will be graded for mechanics (see the "Guidelines" box).

GUIDELINES
 Help ing Students Prepa re for Tests Assessments
General Preparation:
- 1. Suggest ways of studying
- 2. Give practice tasks like those to be used.
- 3. Teach test-taking skills.
- 4. Teach how to write well-organized essay answers.
- 5. Stress the value of tests and assessments for improving learning

 Preparation for Each Test or Assessment

- 1. Announce in advance when the test or assessment will be given.
- 2. Describe the conditions of administration (e.g" I-hour closed book).
- 3. Desa-ibe the length and the types of items or tasks to be used(20 multiple-chOice, three essay items, or one extended-response performance task).
- 4. Describe the content and type of pelformance to be covered (a table of specifications is useful for this).
- 5. Describe how the test or assessment will be scored and how the results will be used.
- 6. Give the students sample items and tasks similar to those to be used (use a sholt practice test or present items orally and discuss responses).
- 7. Relieve anxiety by using a positive approacll in desa-ibing the test or assessment and its usefulness.

##### **Reproducing the Test**

In preparing the test materials for reproduction, it is important that the items be spaced and arranged so that they can be read, answered, and scored with the least amount of difficulty. Cramming too many test items onto a page is poor economy. What little paper is saved will not make up for the time and confusion that results during the administration and scoring of the test.

All test items should have generous borders. Multiple-choice items should have the alternatives listed in a veltical column beneath the stem of the item rather than across the page. Items should not be split, with parts of the item on two different pages. With interpretive exercises, the introductOlY materials can sometimes be placed on a facing page or separate sheet, with all the items referring to it on a single page.

Unless a separate answer sheet is used, the space for answering should be down one side of the page, preferably the left. The most convenient methcxl of response is drcling the letter of the correct answer. With this arrangement, scoring is simply a matter of placing a strip scoring key beside the column of answers.

Test items should be numbered consecutively throughout the test. Each test item will need to be identified during discussion of the test and for other purposes, such as item analysis. When separate answer sheets are used, consecutive numbering is, of course, indispensable.

It is desirable to proofread the entire test or assessment before it is administered. Charts, graphs, and other pictOliai material must be checked. to ensure that the reproduction has been accurate and the details are clear.

#### **ADMINISTERING AND SCORING CLASSROOM TESTS AND ASSESSMENTS**

The same care that went into the preparation of the test or assessment should be carried over into its administration and scoring. Here we are concerned with (a) providing optimum conditions for obtaining the students' responses, and (b) selecting convenient and accurate procedures for scoring the results.

##### **Administration**

The guiding principle in administering any classroom test or assessment is that all students must be given a fair chance to demonstrate their achievement of the learning outcomes being measured. This means a physical and psychological environment conducive to their best efforts and the control of factors that might interfere with valid measurement.

Physical conditions such as adequate work space, qUiet, proper light and ventilation, and comfortable temperature are sufficiently familiar to teachers to warrant little attention here. Of greater importance but frequently neglected are the psychological conditions influencing results. Students will not perform at their best if tl1ey are tense and anxious during testing. The following may create excessive test anxiety.

- 1. Threatening students with tests if they do not behave
- 2. Warning students to do their best "because this test is important"
- 3. Telling students they must work fast in order to finish on time
- 4. Threatening dire consequences if they fail

The antidote to test anxiety is to convey to the students, by both word and deed, that the test and assessment results aJe to be used to help them improve their leaming. They also should be reassured that the time limits are adequate to allow them to complete the test or assessment tasks. This, of course, assumes that the test and assessment results will be used to improve leaming and that the time limits are adequate.

The time of testing can also influence the results. If tests are administered just before the "big game" or the "big dance," the results may not be representative. Flllthermore, for some students, fatigue , the onset of illness, or worry about a particular problem may prevent maximum performance. Arranging the time of testing accordingly and pennitting its postponement when appropriate can enhance the validity of results.

Actual administration is relatively simple because a properly prepared test or assessment is practically self-administering. Oral directions, if used, should be presented clearly. Any sample problems or illustrations put on the board should be kept brief and simple. Beyond this, suggestions for aclministration consist mainly of things to avoid.

1. Do not talk unnecessarily before letting students start working. When a teacher announces that there will be "a full 40 minutes" to complete the test and then talks for the first 10 minutes, students feel that they are being unfairly deprived of testing time. Besides, just before a test is no time to make aSSignments, admonish the class, or introduce next weeks topic. Students are mentally set for the test and will ignore  anything not pertaining to the test for fear it will hinder their recall of information needed to answer the questions. Thus, the well-intentioned remarks merely increase anxiety toward the test and create hostility toward the teacher.

2. Keep interruptions to a minimum. At times, a student will ask to have an ambiguous item clarified, and it may be beneficial to explain the item to the entire group at the same time. Such intemlptions are necessary but should be kept to a minimum. Ali other distractions outside and inside the classroom should, of course, also be eliminated when possible. It is sometimes helpful to hang a "Do not disturb--TESTING" sign outside the door.

3. Avoid giving hints to students who ask about individual items. If the item is ambiguous, it should be clarified for the entire group, as indicated earlier. If it is not ambiguous, refrain from helping the student answer it. Refraining from giving hints to students who ask for help is especially difficult for beginner teachers; but giving unfair aid to some students (the bold, the apple polishers, and so on) decreases the validity of the results and lowers class morale.

4. Discourage cheating, if necessary. When there is good teacher-snldent rapport and the students view tests as helpful rather than hannful, cheating is usually not a problem. Under other conditions, however, it might be necessary to discourage cheating by special seating arrangements and careful supervision. Receiving unauthorized help from other students during a test has the same deletetious effect on validity and class morale as does receiving special hints from the teacher. We are interested in students doing their best; but

 **GUIDELINES**
  Steps to Prevent Cheating

- 1. Take special precautions to keep the test secure during preparation, storage, and administration.
- 2. Have students clear off the tops of their desks (for adequate work space and to prevent use of notes).
- 3. If scratch paper is used (e.g., for math problems), have it turned in with the test.
- 4. Proctor the testing session carefully (e.g., walk around the room periodically and observe how the students are doing).
- 5. Use spedal seating arrangements, if possible (e.g., leave an empty row of seats between students).
- 6. Use two forms of the test and give a different form to each row of students (for this purpose, use the same test but simply rearrange the order of the items for the second form).
- 7. Prepare tests that students will view as relevant, fair, and useful.
- 8. Create and maintain a positive attitude concerning the value of tests for improving learning.

for valid results, their scores must be based on their own unaided efforts. See the "Guidelines" box.

##### **Scoring the Test**

Procedures for scoring performance-based assessments were deso'ibed in Chapter 11. Here we discuss scoring objective items.

If the students' answers are recorded on the test paper itself, a scoring key can be made by marking the correct answers on a blank copy of the test. Scoring then is simply a matter of comparing the columns of answers on this master copy with the columns of answers on each student's paper. A strip key, which consists merely of strips of paper on which the columns of answers are recorded, may also be used if more convenient. These can easily be prepared by cutting the columns of answers from the master copy of the test and mounting them on stlips of cardboard cut from manila folders.

When separate answer sheets are used, a scoring stencil is most convenient. This is a biank answer sheet with hoies punched where the correct answers shouid appear. The stendl is laid over each answer sheet, and the number of marks appearing through the holes are counted. When this type of scoring procedure is used, eacl1 test paper should also be scanned to make certain that only one answer was marked for each item. Any item containing more than one answer should be eliminated from the scoring.

As eacl1 test paper is scored, mark each item that is answered incorrectly. With multiple-choice items, a good practice is to draw a red line through the correct answer of the missed items rather than through the student's wrong answers. This will indicate to the student those items missed and at the same time will indicate the correct answers. Time

will be saved and confusion avoided duling discussion of the test. Marking the con'ect answers of missed items is especially simple with a scoling stencil. When no mark appears through a hole in the stencil, a red line is drawn across the hole.

In scoring objective tests, each correct answer is usually counted as 1 point because an arbitralY weighing of items makes little difference in the students' final scores. If some items are counted as 2 points, some 1 point, and some 05 point, the scoling will be more complicated without any accompanying benefits. Scores based on such weightings will be similar to the simpler procedure of counting each item as 1 point. When a test consists of a combination of objective items and a few more time-consuming essay questions, however, more than a single point is needed to distinguish several levels of response and to reflect the dispropOltionate time devoted to each of the essay questions.

When students are told to answer every item on the test, a student's score is simply the number of items answered correctly. There is no need to consider wrong answers or to correct for guessing. When all students answer every item on a test, the rank of the students' scores will be the same whether the number right or a correction for guessing is used.

See the box "Correction for Guessing" for a simple fonnula that is sometimes used. The formula is based on the questionable assumption that students either know the answer or guess it at random. It is not needed when students are allowed suffident time to respond to all the items on the test. Thus, it is recommended that it *not* be used with the ordinary classroom test. The only exception is when the test is speeded to the extent that students complete different numbers of items. Here its use is defensible because students can increase their scores appreciably by rapidly(and blindly) guessing at the remaining untried items just before the testing period ends.

| Correction for Guessing          |      
Correcting for guessing is usually done when students do not have sufficient time to complete all items on the test and when they have been instructed that there will be a penalty for guessing.
The most common formula used for this purpose is the following:
Score = Right - (Wrong / (n - 1))
In this formula, **n** is the number of alternatives for an item. Thus, the formula applies to various selection-type items as follows:
True-False Items
Score = Right - (Wrong / (2 - 1))
or
Score = Right - Wrong

 Multiple-Choice Items

- **Three alternatives:**  
  `Score = Right - (Wrong / 2)`

- **Four alternatives:**  
  `Score = Right - (Wrong / 3)`

- **Five alternatives:**  
  `Score = Right - (Wrong / 4)`



#### **APPRAISING CLASSROOM TESTS AND ASSESSMENTS**

Before a classroom test or assessment has been administered, it should be evaluated according to the points discussed earlier. The most important of these points are listed in the cl1ecklist "Evaluating the Classroom Assessment." Most of these questions also apply to a pelformance-based assessment. A *yes* response to each of these questions indicates that the test or the assessment has been carefully prepared and will probably function effectively.

After a test or assessment has been scored and the students have discussed the results, it is often simply discarded. Except for the students' criticism during class discussion, which helps identify some of the defective items or ambiguities in a task, the teacher has little evidence concerning the quality of the test or assessment that was used. Much of the careful planning and hard work that went into the preparation of the test or assessment is wasted. A better procedure is to appraise the effectiveness of the test items and assessment tasks and to build a file of high-quality items and tasks for future use.

##### **Determining Item and Task Effectiveness**

The effectiveness of each test item can be determined by analyzing student responses to it. Item analysis is generally associated with a norm-referenced perspective. This is natural because the results of an item analysis can be used to select items of desired difficulty that best discriminate between high- and low-achieving students. Selection on these grounds is not relevant from a criterion-referenced perspective. From both perspectives, however, the resuits of an item anaiysis can be usefui in identifying fauity items and can provide information about student misconceptions and topics that need additional work.

Item analysis is usually designed to answer questions such as the following:

- 1. Did the item function as intended?
- 2. Was the test item of appropriate difficulty?
- 3. \Vas the test item free of irrelevant clues and other defects?
- 4. Were the distracters effective (in multiple-cllOice items)?

Answers to all but the second question are relevant in constructing future tests based on either a norm-referenced or a o "iterion-referenced perspective. The answer to the second question is relevant only when planning future norm-referenced tests; however, it is relevant in instructional planning regardless of perspective.

Answers to such questions are of obvious value in selecting or revising items for future use. The benefits of item analysis are not limited to the improvement of individual test items, however. There are a number of fringe benefits of special value to classroom teachers. The most impOltant of these are the following:

**1.** item-analysis data provide a basis for efficient class discussion of the test results. Knowing how effectively each item or task functioned in measuring achievement makes it possible to confine the discussion to those areas most helpful to students. Misinformation and misunderstandings reflected in the choice of palticular distracters on multiple-chOice problems or frequently repeated elTOl"S on perfonnance tasks can be corrected, thereby enhancing the instructional value of t11e assessment. Item analysis will also expose

technical defects in items and tasks. It can also suggest needed changes in scoring rubrics. During discussion, defective items can be pointed out to students, saving much time and heated discussion conceming the unfaimess of these items. If an item is ambiguous and two answers can be defended equally well, both answers should be counted correct and the scoring adjusted accordingly.

2. Item-analysis data provide a basis for remedial work. Although discussing the test resuits in dass can darify and correct many specific points, item anaiysis frequently brings to light general areas of weakness requiring more extended attention. It is often infOImative to compare actual student performance on a task to the perfonnance expected based on the teacher's notion of how challenging the task would be for students. Performance that is much worse than expected. may suggest the need to revisit palticular critical concepts or topiCS. In a mathematics test, for example, item analysis may reveal that the students are fairly proficienr in mathematics skills but are having difficulty with problems requiring the application of these skills. In other subjects, item analysis may indicate a general weakness in knowledge of technical vocabulary, in an understanding of principles, or in the ability to interpret data. Such infonnation makes it possible to focus remedial work directly on the palticular areas of weakness.

3. Item-analysis data provide a basis for the general improvement of classroom instmction. In addition to the preceding uses, item-analysis data can assist in evaluating appropriateness of the learning outcomes and course content for the particular students being taught. For example, material that is consistently too simple or too difficult might suggest curriculum revisions or shifts in teaching emphasis. Similarly, errors in student thinking that persistently appear in item-analysis data might direct attention to the need for more effective teaching procedures. In these and similar ways, item-analysis data can reveal instructional weaknesses and dues for improvemenr.

4. Item-analysis procedures provide a basis for increased skill in test construction. Item analysis reveals ambiguities, dues, ineffective distracters, and other technical defects that

were missed during the test's preparation. This information is used directly in revising the test items for future use. In addition to the improvement of the specific items, however, we derive benefits from the procedure itself. As we analyze students' responses to items, we become increasingly aware of technical defects and what causes them. When revising the items, we gain experience in rewording statements so that they are clear, rewriting distracters so that they are more plausible, and modifying items so that they are at a more appropriate level of difficulty. As a consequence, our general test construction skills improve.

##### Simplified Item-Analysis Procedures

Gaurse Smart

A simplified form of item analysis is all that is necessary or warranted for classroom tests. Because most classroom groups consist of 20 to 40 students, an especially useful procedure is to compare the responses of the 10 highest-scoring students with the responses of the 10 lowest-scoring students. As we will see later, keeping the upper and lower groups at 10 students each simplifies the interpretation of the results. It also is a reasonable number for analysis in groups of 20 to 40 students. For example, with a small classroom group, like that of 20 or fewer students, it is best to use the upper and lower halves to obtain dependable data, whereas with a larger group, like that of 40 students, use of the upper and lower 25% is quite satisfactory. For more refined analysis, the upper and lower 27% is often recommended, and most statistical guides are based on that percentage.

To illustrate the method of item analysis, suppose that we have just finished scoring 32 test papers for a sixth-grade science unit on weather. Our item analysis might then proceed as follows:

- 1. Rank the 32 test papers in order from the highest to the lowest score.
- 2. Select the 10 papers within the highest total scores and the 10 papers with the lowest total scores.
- 3. Put aside the middle 12 papers, as they will not be used in the analysis.
- 4. For each test item, tabulate the number of students in the upper and lower groups who selected each alternative. This tabulation can be made directly on the test paper or on the test item record, as shown in Figure 14.2.
- 5. Compute the difficulty of each item (percentage of students who got the item right).
- 6. Compute the discriminating power of each item (difference between the number of students in the upper and lower groups who got the item right).
- 7. Evaluate the effectiveness of distracters in each item (attractiveness of the incorrect alternatives).

The first steps of this procedure are merely a convenient tabulation of student responses from which we can readily determine item difficulty, item discriminating power, and the effectiveness of each distracter. This latter information can frequently be obtained simply by inspecting the item-analysis data. Note that in Figure 14.2, for example, when the item was used in the spring of 2006, eight students in the upper group and four students in the lower group selected the correct alternative, B. Thus, 12 of the 20 students

 Figure 14.2
Test item record with item-analysis data

(difficulty = 60%) got the item right, indicating that the item has a moderate difficulty. When the same item was used in 2008, the difficulty was similar (65%) based on 10 students in the upper group and 3 in the lower group for a total of 13 of 20 who selected the COlTect option (B).

Because more students in the upper group than in the lower group got the item right, it is disO"iminating positively in both years. That is, it is distinguishing between high and low achievers (as determined by the total test score). The .40 for the 2006 administration equals the difference in the proportion of students in the upper and lower groups who answered the item conÂ·ectly (8/ 10 - 4/ 10 or .8 - .4). In 2()()8, the discrimination of the items was higher than in 2006 (.70 = 1.00 - .30, the proportions in the upper and lower groups answering the item correctly in 2008). Finally, because all the alternatives were selected by some of the students in the lower group, the distracters (alternatives A, C, and D) appear to be operating effectively.

From a norm-referenced perspective, the fact that in 2008 all 10 students with the highest test scores but only 3 of the 10 with the lowest scores answered the item correctly makes this item a good candidate for use in the future because it helps discriminate between high- and low-achieving students. Although this would not be a basis for selecting an item for a criterion-referenced test, it does provide an indication that the item is keyed COllÂ·ectly and that it is not being misintelpreted by the higher-achieving students. It also provides an indication that some students do not understand the uses of instruments listed.

Although item analysis by inspection will reveal the general effectiveness of a test item and is satisfactory for most classroom purposes, it is sometimes useful to obtain a more precise estimate of item difficulty and discriminating power. This can be done by applying relatively simple formulas to the item-analysis data .

Computing Item Difficulty. The difficulty of a test item that is scored right or wrong is indicated by the percentage of students who get the item right. Hence, we can compute item difficulty *(P)* by means of the following formula , in which *R* equals the number of students who got the item right and T equals the total number of students who tried the item:

p = 100R/ T

Applying this formula to the item-analysis data in Figure 14.2, our index of item difficulty is 65% for the Aplil 30, 200S, test as follows:

$$P = 100 \text{ \* } 13/20 = 65\%$$

In computing item difficulty from item-analysis data, our calculation is based on the upper and lower groups only. We assume that the responses of students in the middle group follow essentially the same pattern. This estimate of difficulty is sufficiently accurate for classroom use and is easily obtained because the needed figures can be taken directly from the item-analysis data.

Note that because our item analysis is based on 10 in the upper group and 10 in the lower group, all we need to do to obtain item difficulty is to divide the number getting it right by 2 (13/2 = 6.5), move the decimal point one place to the right (65), and add the percent sign (65%). In other words, 13 of 20 is the same as 6.5 of 10, which is 65%. In April 2006, when 12 students got the item right, item difficulty was 6 of 10 (12/2 = 6), or 60%. This may seem a bit confusing at first, but once you grasp the idea, you can compute item difficulty very quickly. As noted earlier, the ease of interpreting item statistics is one of the advantages of using 10 in each group. If more (or fewer) than 10 are used, the formula for computing item difficulty is the same, but it is much more difficult to compute the results mentally.

Similar calculations are used for a task scored 0, 1,2, or 3 to get the overall mean for the students in the upper and lower groups combined. That is, the average would simply be the sum of the means for the upper and lower groups divided by 2.

Computing Item Discriminating Power. As we have already stated, an item discriminates positively if more students in the upper group than the lower group get the item right. Positive discrimination indicates that the item is disaÂ·iminating in the same direction as the total test score. Because we assume that the total test score reflects achievement of desired objectives, we would like all our test items to show positive discrimination.

The discriminating power of an achievement test item refers to the degree to which it discriminates between SUI dents with high and low achievement. Item-discriminating power *(D)* can be obtained by subtracting the number of students in the lower group who get the item right *(RL)* from the number of students in the upper group who get the item right *(RU)* and dividing by one half the total number of students included in the item analysis *(,5T).* Summarized in formula form, it is as follows:

$$D = (RU - RL) \langle (SAT) \rangle$$

Applying this formula to the item-analysis data for April 2008 in Figure 14.2, we obtain an index of discriminating power of .70 as follows:

$$D = (10 - 3) / 10 = .70$$

This indicates approximately average diso'inlinating power. An item with maximum positive discriminating power is one in wllich all students in the upper group get the item right and all the students in the lower group get the item wrong. This results in an index of 1.00, as follows:

$$D = (10 - 0) / 10 = 1.00$$

An item with no diso'iminating power is one in which an equal number of students in both the upper and the lower groups get the item right. This results in an index of .00, as follows:

$$D = (10 - 10) \text{\textdegree } 10 \text{\textdegree \dots oo}$$

When our item analysis is based on 10 in the upper group and 10 in the lower group , the index of discriminating power, like item difficulty, can be computed easily and quickly. All we need to do is subtract the number in the lower group who get it right from the number in the upper group who get it right (10 - 3 = 7), move the decimal point one place to the left (.7), and add a zero after it (.70). With 10 in each group, the index of discrimination is essentially the difference between the number getting it right in the two groups with the decimal point moved one place to the left. The zero is added simply because the index of discrimination is usually carried to two decimal places. With more than 10 in each group, we could not make these simple mental calculations but would have to resort to use of the formula.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Distr:lcte rs. How well each distracter is operating can be detelmined by inspection, so there is no need to calculate an index of effectiveness, although the formula for discriminating power can be used for this purpose. In general, a good distracter attracts more students from the lower group than the upper group. Thus, it should discriminate between the upper and lower groups in a manner opposite to that of the correct alternative. An examination of the following item-analysis data will illustrate the ease with which the effectiveness of distracters can be determined by inspection. Alternative A is the con'ect answer:

| Alternatives | (A) | B | C | D | Omits |
|--------------|-----|---|---|---|-------|
| Upper 10     | 5   | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0     |
| Lower 10     | 3   | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0     |

First, note that the item cliscriminates positively because five in the upper group and three in the lower group got the item right. The index of discriminating power is fairly low, however (D ~ .20), and this may be partly due to the ineffectiveness of some of the distracters. Alternative B is a poor distracter because it attracts more students from the upper gmup than fmm the lower group. This is most likely due to some ambiguity in the statement of the item. Alternative C is evidently not a plausible distracter because it attracted no one. Alternative D is functioning as intended, for it attracts a larger proportion of students from tile lower group. TIlLIS, ilie discriminating power of tI1is item can probably be improved by removing any ambiguity in the statement of the item and revising or replacing alternatives Band C. The specific changes must, of course, be based on an inspection of tile test item itself; item-analysis data merely inclicate poorly functioning items, not the cause of the poor functioning.

In some cases, an exan1ination of the test item will reveal no obvious en-or in the structure of the item and it may be best to tIy it with a second group. The number of cases involved is so small that considerable variation in student response can be expected from one group to another. A casual comment by the teacher or some other classroom event may cause students to select or reject a particular alternative.

Recording item Analysis Data on the Test Paper. There is some advantage in recording item-analysis data directly on the test paper that was used as a scoring key, as shown in Figure 14.3, and making the calculations mentally. These mental calculations for the two items in Figure 14.3 are summarized in Figure 14.4. Thus, during discussion of tile test results, you can quickly judge the difficulty and discriminating power of each item and the effectiveness of ilie distracters. This will help determine how much discussion to devote to any particular item, the types of misconceptions students may have (by the distracters selected), and whicll items are so defective that they might be discounted. See "Item Analysis by Computer" for a look at another way to analyze test items.

##### **Cautions in I nterpreting Item-Analysis Results**

Item analysis is a quick, simple teclmique for appraising the effectiveness of individual test items. The information from such an analysis is limited in many ways, however and must be interpreted accordingly. Observe tile following major cautions.

1. Item discriminating power does not indicate item vaJiclity. In our description of item analysis, we used tile total test score as a basis for selecting tile upper group (high achievers) and the lower group (low achievers). This is the most common procedure because comparable measures of achievement are usually not available. Ideally, we would examine each test item in relation to some independent measure of achievement. However, the best measure of the particular achievement we are interested in assessing is usually the total score on the achievement test we have constructed because each classroom test

is related to specific instructional objectives and course content. Even standardized tests in the same content area are usually inadequate as independent criteria because they are aimed at more general objectives than those measured by a classroom test in a palticular course.

Using the total score from our classroom test as a basis for se lecting high and low achievers is perfectly legitimate as long as we remember that we are using an internal criterion. In doing so, our item analysis offers evidence concerning the internal consistency of the test rather than its validity. That is, we are determining how effectively each test item is measuring whatever the whole test is measuring. Such item-analysis data can be interpreted as evidence of item validity only when the validity of the total test has been proven or can be legitimately assumed. This is seldom possible with classroom tests, so we must be satisfied with a more limited interpretation of our item-analysis data.

2. A low index of discliminating power does not necessarily indicate a defective item. Items that diso'iminate poorly between high and low acllievers should be examined for the possible presence of ambiguity, clues, and other teclmical defects. If none is found and the items measure an impOltant leaming outcome, they should be retained for future use. Any item that discriminates in a positive direction can contribute to the measurement of student achievement, and low indexes of discrimination are frequently obtained for reasons other than technical defects.

Classroom achievement tests are usually designed to measure several different types of learning outcomes (knowledge, understanding, application, and so on). When this is the case, test items tlut represent an area receiving relatively little emphasis will tend to have poor discriminating power. For example, if a test Ius 40 items measuring knowledge of facts and 10 items measuring understanding, the latter items can be expected to have low indexes of discrimination, because the items measuring understanding have less representation in the total test score and there is typically a low correlation between measures of knowledge and measures of understanding. Low indexes of discrimination here merely indicate that tllese items are measuring something different from what the major pan of the test is measuring. Removing such items from the test would make it a more homogeneous measure of knowledge outcomes, but it would also damage the test's validity because it would no longer measure leaming outcomes in the understanding area. Because most classroom tests measure a variety of types of learning outcomes, low positive indexes of discrimination are the rule ratller than the exception.

Another factor that influences discriminating power is the difficulty of tile item. Those items at the 50% level of difficulty make maximum diso'iminating power possible because only at this level of difficulty can all students in upper half of the group  get the item right and all students in the lower half get it wrong. The *5()OIo* level of difficulty does not guarantee maximum discriminating power but merely makes it possible. If half the students in the upper group and half the students in the lower group got the item right, the level of difficulty would still be 50%, but the index of discrimination would be zero. As we move away from the 50% level of difficulty toward easier or more difficult items, the index of discriminating power becomes smaller. Thus, items that are very easy or very difficult have low indexes of discIiminating power. Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to retain such items, however, in order to measure a representative sample of learning outcomes and course content. To summarize, a low index of discriminating power should alert us to the possible presence of technical defects in a test item but should not cause us to discard an otherwise worthwhile item. A well-constructed achievement test will, of necessity, contain items with low discriminating power; to discard them would result in a less, rather than more, valid test.

3. Item-analysis data from small samples are highly tentative. Item-analysis procedures focus our attention so directly on a test item's difficulty and discriminating power that we are commonly misled into believing tllat *tllese* are fIXed, unchanging characteristics. This, of course, is not true. Item-analysis data will valY from one group to another, depending

##### Item Analysis by Computer

Many schools now have computers (or have access to them) that can both score and analyze tests. The computer printout will provide item-analysis information, a reliability coefficient, standard error of measurement for the test, and various other types of information concerning the performance of the individuals tested and the d1aracteristics of the test. The nature of the infonnation depends on the sophistication of the computer and the program tl1at is used.

When item analysis is done by computer, the scores of the entire group are usually used rather than just the scores of the upper and lower groups. The total set of scores might be divided into two, three, four, or five levels, depending on the size of the group and the types of analyses. Item-analysis data on a computer printout based on 50 pupils might appear as foHows, for each item.

##### **Item-Response Pattern**

| Item 1        | A | B | (C) | D | E | Omit | Total | Item Statistics    |
|---------------|---|---|-----|---|---|------|-------|--------------------|
| Upper 30%     | 1 | 1 | 12  | 1 | 0 | 0    | 15    | Difficulty 60%     |
| Middle 4()O/o | 2 | 2 | 12  | 3 | 1 | 0    | 20    | Discrimination .40 |
| Lower 3()O/o  | 2 | 3 | 6   | 3 | 1 | 0    | 15    |                    |
| Total         | 5 | 6 | 30  | 7 | 2 | 0    | 50    |                    |

The item-response data indicate how many pupils, at eadl level, selected the correct answer (C) and how many selected eadl of *tlle* distracters.The item statistics at the right indicate the index of difficulty and tlle index of discrin1ination for this item. Some computer programs report only ilie item statistics, but the item-response pattern is espedally valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of the distracters and planning for item revision. Alternative E, for example, shouid be examined to determine whether it can be repiaced by a more effeciive distracter because it is rarely selected.

The following Web sites provide information about two of the many item-analysis computer programs that are available.

ITEMAN at http://www.assess.com Remark Products at http://www.gravie.com/remark/ on the students' level of ability, educational background, and type of instruction they have had. Add to this the small number of students available for analyzing the items in our classroom tests, and the tentative nature of our item-analysis data becomes readily apparent. If just a few students change their responses, our indexes of difficulty and disO"iminating power can be increased or decreased by a considerable amount.

The tentative naUlre of item-analysis data should discourage us from making fine distinctions among items on the basis of indexes of difficulty and discriminating power. If an item is disCliminating in a positive direction, ali the alternatives are functioning effectively, and it has no apparent defects, then it can be considered satisfactory from a technical standpOint. TIle important question then is **not** how high the index of cliscrin1inating power is but whether the item measures an important learning outcome. In the final analysis, the wOlth of an achievement test item must be based on logical rather than statistical considerations.

When llSed with norm-referenced classroom tests, item analysis provides us with a general appraisal of the functional effectiveness of the test items, a means for detecting defects, and a method for identifying instructional weaknesses. For these purposes, the tentative nature of item-analysis data is relatively unimportant. When we record indexes of item difficulty or disaiminating power on item records for future use, we should intelpret them as rough approxi.n1ations only. As SUcll, they are still superior to our unaided estimates of item difficulty and disO"iminating power.

##### **Application of Item-Analysis Principles With Performance-Based Assessments**

Item-analysis procedures have somewhat Limited applicability with performance-based assessments, primarily because such assessments generally contain a relatively small number of tasks. If the assessment has several tasks, however, the general principles can be readily adapted for use. One necessary modification results from the fact that scores on perfonnance-based tasks almost always involve more than a simple 0 or 1. For example, each task might have possible scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Still, a comparison of the individual task scores for the 10 highest and 10 lowest scoring students can be useful.

Suppose, for example, that a performance assessment consisted of five separate tasks, each of which had possible scores ranging from a low of 0 for no response or a response that was unrelated to the task, to a 4 for a complete and well-elaborated response. Possible total scores for the set of five tasks would range from 0 to 20. As before, the total scores would be ranked to identify the 10 highest and the 10 lowest scores. The individual task scores for these two groups of SUI dents would then be summarized as illustrated in Figure 14.5. The **10** highest-achieving students generally have higher scores on each item than the 10 lowest-achieving students. The higher average score on Task 1 for the upper **10** students than for the lower **10** indicates that the task discriminates between these two groups. The equal means on Task 2 for the two groups of students indicate that the latter task does not disO"i.minate.

A couple of possible reasons for results such as those shown in Figure 14.5 need to be considered. It is possible that Task 2 simply has less similarity than Task 1 to the remaining tasks; that is, it calls for different skills and abilities than the other four tasks. It

| Task 1   |   |   |   |   |   |         |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---------|
| Score    | 0 |   | 2 | 3 | 4 | Average |
| Upper 10 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 5 | 3.4     |
| Lower 10 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 1.7     |
| Task 2   |   |   |   |   |   |         |
| Score    | 0 |   | 2 | 3 | 4 | Average |
| Upper 10 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1.5     |
| Lower 10 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1.5     |

 Figure 14.5

Illustrative analysis of scores on two tasks

may be that the type of performance expected on Task 2 is ambiguous. If careful review of the task in comparison to the other four tasks leads to the first conclusion, then there is no need to revise or discard the task. If a review leads to the second conclusion, however, then the task would need to be either discarded or revised to clarify what is intended.

#### **BUILDING A FILE OF EFFECTIVE ITEMS AND TASKS**

A file of effective items and tasks can be built and maintained easily if items and tasks are recorded on records like the one shown in Figure 14.2. By indicating on the record both the objective and the content area being measured, it is possible to file the records under both headings. Course content can be used as major categories, with the objectives forming the subcategories. For example, the item in Figure 14.2 measures knowledge of weather instruments, so it is placed in the first category under weather instruments as follows:

Weather Instruments

Knowledge

Understanding

Application

This type of filing system makes it possible to select items or tasks in accordance with any table of specifications in the particular area covered by the file. See the box "Item Banking by Computer" for a description of an other way to build an assessment bank.

Building a file of effective items and tasks is a little like building a bank account. The first several years are concerned mainly with making deposits; withdrawals must be delayed until a suffident reserve is accumulated. Thus, items and tasks are recorded on records as they are constructed; information from analyses of student responses is added after the items and tasks have been used, and then the effective items and tasks are deposited in the file. At first, it seems to be additional work, with VeIY little return. However, in a few years, it is possible to start using some of the items and tasks from d1e file and

supplementing these with newly constructed items and tasks. As the file grows, it becomes possible to select the majority of the items and tasks from the file for any given test or assessment withollt repeating them too frequently. To prevent using a test item or assessment task too often, record the date it is used.

A file of effective items and tasks assumes increasing importance as we shift from test items that measure knowledge of facts to items and tasks that measure understanding, application, and thinking skills. Items and tasks in these areas are difficult and time consuming to construct. With all tlle other demands on our time, it is nearly impossible to construct effective test items or assessment tasks in tllese areas each time we prepare a new test or assessment. We have two alternatives: Either we neglect the measurement of learning outcomes in these areas (which, unfortunately, has been tlle practice), or we slowly build a me of effective items and tasks in mese areas. If quality of student learning is our major concern, tlle choice is obvious.

#### **SUMMARY**

Some of the topics considered in this chapter are more relevant to traditional classroom tests involving right- wrong or single-best-answer items than to complex, perfonnance-based tasks involving extended responses and more complicated scoring procedures. Test assembly and item analysis, for example, are more relevant for a classroom test containing many items than for a performance assessment involving a single task for a class period. At a conceptual level, however, me general principles considered in this chapter apply to complex performancebased assessments as well as to classroom tests involving only objective items.

The same care that goes into the construction of individual test items and assessment tasks should be carried over into me final stages of development and use. Attending to

##### Item Banking by Computer

Some schools use computers to maintain systematic item files (or item pools) for each of the various subjects and grade levels. The items are coded and stored by the test builder for easy retrieval. The code includes SUcll things as instructional level, subject area, instructional objective, content topic, and item statistics (eg difficulty and discrin1ination indexes). This makes it possible to select items and build a test that matclles a panicular set of test specifications. The coded information concerning each item also aids in arranging the items in the test (e.g. , by objective or order of difficulty).

The computer will print out these customdesigned tests and will also score, repon, and analyze memo For examples and additional information, see the following Web sites: Assessment System Corporation

Computer item banks are like any other item pool-you get out only what you put in. If you store ineffective items, you will get back ineffective items. Thus, item banking by computer requires careful screening of the items before they are entered.

the procedures for assembling, administering, scoring, and appraising the results will increase assurance that results are valid.

The preliminary steps in preparing the test will be simpler if items are recorded on cards. This facilitates the task of editing and arranging the items. Editing includes checking eacll item to make certain that its format is appropriate, that it is relevant to the specific learning outcome it measures, and that it is free from ambiguity, irrelevant clues, and nonfunctioning material. The final group of items selected for the test also should be checked against the table of specifications or other test plan to ensure that a representative sample of the learning outcomes and course content is being measured. In arranging the items in the test, all items of one type should be placed together in a separate section. The items within eacll section should be organized by the learning outcome measured and then placed in order of ascending difficulty.

The directions for the test or assessment should clearly convey the purpose of the measurement, the time allowed to finish, the basis for responding, and the procedure for recording the responses. The directions should indicate what to do about guessing for selection-type items. For performance-based tasks, the directions should describe the scoring procedure.

The procedures for administering the test or assessment should give aU students a fair chance to demonstrate their achievement. Both the physical and the psychological atmosphere should be conducive to maximum performance. Unnecessary interruptions and unfair aid from other students or the teacher should be avoided.

Scoring the test can be facilitated by a scoring key or scoring stencil if separate answer sheets are used. Counting each right answer as 1 point is usually satisfactOlY. A correction for guessing is unnecessary  on a typical classroom test for which students have sufficient time. Because assumptions underlying the use of correction-for-guessing formulas are debatable, it is recommended that they be used only with speeded tests. For most classroom tests, it is satisfactory to tell students to answer every question and then simply count the number of correct answers.

After the test has been scored, you should appraise the effectiveness of each item by means of item analysis. Use simple statistical procedures for determining the index of item difficulty (percentage of students who got the item right), item-discriminating power (the difference between high and low achievers), and the effectiveness of each distracter (degree to which it attracts more low acllievers than high achievers). Item-analysis indexes can be computed quickly and easily if the data are based on the 10 highest-scoring and 10 lowest-scoring students (for class sizes ranging from 20 to 40 students). Because criterion-referenced mastery tests are designed to describe the learning tasks that students can perform rather than to discriminate among students, traditional indexes of item analysis are not used to select items for future tests--but they are relevant for detecting faulty items and for planning instruction. The results of item analysis are valuable in discussing the test with students, in planning remedial work, in improving teaching and testing skills, and in selecting and revising items for future use. Item-analysis data must always be interpreted cautiously because of their limited and tentative nature.

Building a file of effective test items and assessment tasks involves recording the items or tasks, adding information from analyses of student responses, and filing the records by both the content area and the objective that the item or task measures. Such a file is especially valuable in areas of complex achievement, when the constlUction of test items

and assessment tasks is difficult and time consuming. When enough high-quality items and tasks have been assembled, the burden of preparing tests and assessments is considera bly lightened. Computer item banking makes the task even easier and is available in many schools.

### CHAPTER 15: GRADING AND REPORTING**

G rading and repOlting student progress is one of the more fmstrating aspects of teaching- there are so many factors to consider and so many decisions to be made. This chapter removes some of the complexity by describing the various types of grading and reporting systems and providing guidelines for their effective use.

The task of reporting student progress cannot be separated from the procedures used in assessing student learning and development. If instructional objectives have been clearly defined in performance terms and relevant tests and other assessment procedures have been properly used, grading and repOiting become a matter of summarizing the results and presenting them in understandable form. The task is still a perplexing one, however, because the evidence of learning and development must be presented on a very brief report form that is understandable to a variety of users(eg: students, parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators).

As we discussed in Chapter 12, the systematic collection of student work into a portfolio can provide an effective means of reporting student progress. In most Scl1001s, however, teachers are required to submit a grade that provides the overall summary of student achievement for the semester or school year. Reporting student progress becomes especially difficult when the vast array of assessment data must be summarized as a single letter grade (e.g. , A, S , C, D, F) or numerical value. Should the assigned grade represent achievement only, or should effort and work habits be included? How should the various aspects of achievement (e.g., tests, daily assignments, reports, lab work, and responses to oral questioning) be weighted and combined? Should the achievement be judged in relation to other students, some absolute standard, or the individual's learning potential? What distribution of grades (Le., A, B, C, D, F) should be used, and how should this be determined? How can student work be displayed to illustrate progress, strengths, and weaknesses to students and parents? There are no simple answers to these questions.

School or state policies may provide guidelines for answering some of these questions. For example, it may be specified that grades are to be based solely on student acllievement.

367

Verbal labels such as "excellent," "proficient," or "above average" may be assodated with the grade. Guidelines may also specify a standards-based or comparative orientation. But the specifics of deciding how to implement pelformance standards, when a performance meets a profidency standard, and how to combine the infoonation obtained from classroom observations, homework assignments, tests, assessments, and projects of various types still must be addressed by individual teachers.

Even when sc!1001s or states provide guidelines for assigning grades, specific implementation practices valY from school to school and from teacher to teac!1er within the same school. Many schools have circumvented the problems of using a single letter grade by supplementing it with a more elaborate reporting system. Some of these systems will be described here , but first let us consider some of the functions served by a grading and repolting system.

#### **FUNCTIONS OF GRADING AND REPORTING SYSTEMS**

School grading and reporting systems are designed to serve a valiety of functions in the school. These include instntctional uses, reports to parents, and administrative and guidance uses.

##### **Instructional Uses**

learning and development. This is most likely to occur when the report (a) clarifies the instntctional objectives, (b) indicates the student's strengths and weaknesses in leaming, (c) provides information concerning the student's personal-sodal development, and (d) contlibutes to the student's motivation. These functions require a much more comprehensive repolt than the single letter grade.

The improvement of student learning is probably best ac!1ieved by the day-to-day assessments of learning and the feedback from tests and other assessment procedures. A portfolio of work designed to display progress can show the strides that have been made during the year with concrete examples. However, students and parents also seem to need a periodic summary of their learning progress. They fmd it difficult to integrate test scores, ratings, and other assessment results into a SUmffiaIY of how they are doing. A well-designed repolt form, together with a portfolio of student work that contains carefully selected examples, can provide this systematic summalY of learning progress. If they are sufficiently detailed, d1e report and poltfolio of work can pinpoint strengths and weaknesses in learning with implications for corrective action. They also can help communicate desired learning outcomes.

Periodic progress reports can contribute to student motivation by providing short-teon goals and knowledge of results. Both are essential features of effective learning. How motivating the reports are likely to be, however, depends on the nature of the report and how it is used. **If** a single letter grade is used and students are threatened with low grades unless they study harder, me results are likely to have a negative impact. However, if a comprehensive repOIt of learning strengths and weaknesses is used and the report is

presented as an opportunity to check on progress, motivation toward improved learning is likely to result.

As was discussed in Chapter 12, involvement of students in the selection of examples of work to include in a portfolio can encourage reflection on standards of performance. Asking students to select their best piece of writing and to explain why they chose that piece encourages self-reflection and self-evaluation. The inclusion of examples that show early efforts, teacller feedback, and final products can illustrate progress and help students internalize performance standards.

Well-designed progress reports can also aid in evaluating instructional procedures by identifying areas needing revision. When a majority of students have reports showing poor learning progress in a palticular area , there may be a need to modify the instructional objectives or the classroom activities. In other cases, the repOlts may indicate that some special instructional activities would be beneficial for small groups or individuals.

##### **Reports to Parents/Guardians**

Informing parents (or guardians) of their children's school progress is a basic function of a grading and reporting system. These reports should help parents understand the objectives of the school and how well their children are acllieving the intended learning outcomes of their palticular program. This information is impOltant from several viewpoints. First, by knowing what the school is attempting to do, parents are better able to cooperate with the school in promoting their children's learning and development. Second, information concerning their children's successes, failures, and spedal problems enabies parents to give them the emotional support and encouragement needed. Third, knowing their children's strengths and weaknesses in learning provides a basis for helping them make more sound educational and vocational plans. To serve these purposes adequately, the reports and portfolios of student work should contain as much information and detail as parents can comprehend and use. At the elementary level, the report form is frequently supplemented by parent-teacher conferences.

##### **Administrative and Guidance Uses**

Grades and progress reports serve a number of administrative fu nctions. They are used for detennining promotion and graduation, awarding honors, determining athletic eligibility, and reporting to oilier schools and prospective employers. For most administrative purposes, a single letter grade is typically required. Such grades have appeal, in palt, because they are compact and can be easily recorded and averaged.

There is little doubt that the convenience of the single letter grade in administrative work has been a major factor in retarding the development of more comprehensive and useful progress reports. This need not be the case, however. When a new reponing system is being developed, it is possible to retain the use of letter grades for administrative purposes and supplement them with the type of information needed by students, parents, teachers, and counselors. At the high school level, the retention of letter grades is almost mandatory because most college admission offices insist on tllem.

Counselors use repolts on student achievement and development, along with oilier information, to help students make realistic educational and vocational plans. Reports that

include ratings o n personal and social characteristics are also useful in helping students with adjustment problems. These guidance functions are best served by a reporting system that is both comprehensive and detailed.

In summary, the diverse functions to be selved by a grading and reporting system indicate that more elaborate reports are needed than the traditional single letter grade. This does not mean that letter grades should be discarded. They are convenient, easily averaged, useful for administrative functions, and required for college admissions. Instead, letter grades should be supplemented by the type of infomlation needed. by the various lIsers of the repolts. When this is done, the letter grade can be retained as a pure measure of achievement, and such factors as effort, attitude, work habits, and personal-social characteristics can be repolted separately.

#### **TYPES OF GRADING AND REPORTING SYSTEMS**

Throughout the history of education, letter grades have been the primary method of repolting student progress in school. Various studies have indicated that approximately 50% to 90% of all schools use letter grades. In some cases, especially at the elementary level, the repOit fonn also includes a series of work habits and personal-social cl1aracteristics to be checked by the teacher. Various attempts have been made to replace or improve the traditional report fonn. The modifications typically represent some type of compromise between the need for detailed information and the need for simplicity and conciseness.

##### Traditional letter-Grade **System**

The traditional use of the letter-grade system is to assign a single letter grade (e.g., A, B, e, D, F) for each subject. In some cases a single number (e.g. , 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 100, 95 , 90) is used instead of a letter, but the grading system is essentially the same. This system is concise and convenient, the grades are easily averaged, and they are useful in predicting future achievement, but they have the following shortcomings when used as the sole method of reporting.

- 1. They typically are a combination of achievement, effolt, work habits, and good behavior.
- 2. The propoltion of students assigned each letter grade varies from teacl1er to teacher.
- 3. They do not indicate a students specific strengths and weakness in learning

These limitations of the single letter grade make them difficult to interpret and use. A grade of e, for example, may represent good acl1ievement but poor work habits and dismptive behavior or poor achievement accompanied by attentiveness, strong effort, and good behavior. In reacting to criticisms that the letter-grade system fosters unfair competition among students, some schools have reduced the number of grades to two (e.g., S ~ satisfactory, U ~ unsatisfactory) or three (e.g., by adding H ~ honors). Stanclardsbased efforts have also led *to* the use of a small number of categories corresponding to the performance standards for which a variety of labels are used in different states and

##### **Pass- Fail System**

A two-category system (e.g., satisfactOly-unsatisfactory, pass-fail) has been used in some elementary schools for many years. More recently, it has also been used in some high schools and colleges. At these levels, it typically serves as an option to the traditional letter grade in a limited number of courses. It permits students to take some courses, usually elective courses, under a pass-fail option that is not included in their grade-point average. The intent is to encourage students to explore new areas, even those for which they are not fully prepared. It also permits students to focus on those aspects of a course t1lat relate most directly to their major field of study and to neglect those areas of little interest or relevance. Removing the fear of a lower grade-point average gives sUldents greater freedom to select their leaming experiences.

Like any two-categolY system, the pass-fail option is easy to use, but it offers less infonnation than the traditional (A, B, C, D, F) system. It provides no indication of the level of learning, and thus its value for describing present performance or predicting future achievement is lost. Also, study effort is frequently directed toward merely passing rather than a higher level of achievement. Despite its shortCOmings, however, the pass-fail option can serve the purposes for whidl it is intended if its use is restricted to a small number of courses

A pass-no grade grading system is often used for courses taught under a pure mastery learning approad1. Here, where students are expected to demonstrate mastery of all course objectives before receiving credit for a course, a simple *pass* is all that is needed to indicate mastelY. The practice of assigning a letter grade of A to all SUI dents who complete a course under nlastery conditions, as is sometimes done, simply adds greater confusion to the meaning of letter grades. When the pass-no grade system is used, nothing is recorded on a student's school record until mastery of the course is demonstrated. The mastelY learning approach presupposes that each student will be given as much time as needed to attain mastery of the course objectives. Thus, the school record remains a blank until the course is successfully completed.

##### **Checklists of Objectives** 

To provide more informative progress reports, some Sdlools have replaced or supplemented the traditional grading system with a list of objectives to be checked or rated. These repolts, whidl are most common at the elementalY school level, typically include ratings of progress toward the major objectives in each subject-matter area. The following statements for reading and arithmetic illustrate the nature of these repoltS:

 Reading

- 1. Reads witll understanding
- 2. Works out meaning and use of new words
- 3. Reads well to others
- 4. Reads independently for pleasure

 Arithmetic

- 1. Uses fundamental processes
- 2. Solves problems involving reasoning
- 3. Is accurate in work
- 4. Works at a satisfactory rate

The symbols used to rate students on each of these major objectives vary considerably. In some schools, the traditional A, E, C, D, F lettering system is retained , but more commonly there is a shift to fewer symbols, such as 0 (outstanding), S (satisfactory), and N (needs improvement) or P (proficient), PP (practically proficient), and N (needs improvement).

The checklist fonn of reporting has the obvious advantage of providing a detailed analysis of the student's strengths and weaknesses so that constructive action can be taken to help improve learning. It also provides students, parents, and others with a frequent reminder of the objectives of the school. The main difficulties encountered with such repotts are in keeping the list of sta tements down to a workable number and in stating them in such simple and concise terms that they are readily understood by all users of the repolts. These difficulties are probably best overcome by obtaining the cooperation of parents and students during the development of the report form.

##### **Lette rs to ParentsiCuardians**

Some schools have turned to the use of letters to provide for greater flexibility in reporting student progress to parents (or guardians). Letters make it possible to report on the unique strengths, weaknesses, and learning needs of each student and to suggest specific plans for improvement. In addition, the repott can include as much detail as is needed to make clear the student's progress in all areas of development.

Although letters to parents might provide a good supplement to other types of reports, their usefulness as the sole method of reporting progress is limited by the following factors.

- 1. Comprehensive and thoughtful written reports require an excessive amount of time and skill.
- 2. Descriptions of a student'S learning weaknesses are easily misinterpreted by parents
- 3. Letters fail to provide a systematiC and cumulative record of student progress toward the objectives of the school.

The flexibility of this method, whidl is one of its major strengths, limits its usefulness in maintaining systematiC records. Because different aspects of development are likely to be stressed from one report to another, the continuity in reporting is lost.

When used in connection with a more fonnal reporting system, the informal letter can serve a useful role in clarifying specific points in the report and in elaborating on various aspects of student development. Letters can also be an effective supplement to a pottfolio of student work by providing an overview of the portfolio entries and calling attention to palticular things that the parent might consider in reviewing the portfolio. In general, letters probably should be restricted to this supplementary role, however, and be used only as needed for clarification. See the box "Tactful Remarks for Reporting to Parents" for some extreme examples that illustrate the touchiness of reporting to parents.

##### **Portfolios of Student Work**

Portfolios of student work were discussed in greater detail in Chapter 12. As we noted there, a carefully constructed poltfolio can be an effective means of showing student progress, illustrating strengths, and identifying areas where greater effort is needed. The process of identifying products for the portfolio and commenting on the entries can help students gain a better understanding of expectations and standards of excellence. The portfolio is also an effective means of making grades and other sununary reports more concrete for parents and guardians by illustrating both progress and cunent levels of student achievement.

An effective portfolio is more than simply a file into which student work products are placed. It is a purposefully selected collection of work that often contains commentary on the entries by both students and teachers. The entries in the portfolio need to be selected to illustrate the range of student work (e.g. , types of writing, types of mathematical problems, or results of laboratory experiments). The entries also need to be selected to illustrate progress during the year (e.g., products from different parts of the school year) and, in some cases, progress from early to later stages of completing a project (e.g., drafts, revisions, and final versions of a project)

##### **Parent-Teacher Conferences**

To overcome the limited information provided by the traditional report card and to establish better cooperation between teacllers and parents (or guardians), some schools

 Tactful Remarks for Reporting to Parents A teacher listed tactful ways of reporting to parents conceming their children's

misbehavior in school. It included items such as the following:

- Lying: "Presents interesting oral reports but has difficulty in differentiating between factual and imaginary material."
- Cheating: "Uses all available resources in obtaining answers but needs help in detennining when it is appropriate and inappropriate to get assistance from other students. "
- Bullying: "Has leadership qualities but needs to redirect them into more constructive activities."
- Laziness: "Works on school tasks when given ampie supervision but needs to develop independent work habits. "

Caution: Although tact is deSirable, it should not be an excuse for obscuring the message.

use regularly scheduled parent-teacher conferences. This reporting method is most widely used at the elementary level, with its greatest use in the primary grades.

The parent-teacher conference is a flexible procedure that provides for two-way communication between home and schooL Besides receiving a report from the teacher, parents have an 0PPOltUnity to present information concerning the student's out-of-school life. The conference permits teachers and parents to ask questions, discllss their common concerns in helping the student, and cooperatively plan a program for improving the student's learning and development. The give-and-take in sllch a conference makes it possible to avoid or overcome any misunderstandings concerning the student's progress.

Structuring a conference around a portfolio of student work can greatly facilitate communication between a teacher and parent by using explidt examples of accomplishments and progress. As was discussed in Chapter 12, portfolios can also provide a useful basis for a three-way conference of student, parent, and teacher.

The parent-teacher conference is an extremely useful tool, but it shares two important limitations with the informal letter: (a) It requires a substantial amount of time and skill, and (b) it does not provide a systematic record of student progress. In addition, some parents (or guardians) are unwilling or unable to come for conferences. Thus, it is most useful as a supplementary method of reporting.

#### MULTIPLE GRADING AND REPORTING SYSTEMS
Schools have used traditional letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) to report student progress for more than 80 years despite efforts to replace tl1em with a more meaningful report. Their continued lise indicates that they are serving some useful functions in the school (e.g. , administrative). They are a simple and convenient means of maintaining permanent school records. Thus, rather than replace letter (or number) grades, it seems more sensible to try to improve the letter-grade system and supplement it witl1 more detailed and meaningful repOlts of student learning progress. Some schools already use multiple grading and repolting systems.

The typical multiple reporting system retains the use of traditional grading (letter grades or numbers) and supplements the grades with checklists of objectives. In some cases, two grades are assigned to each subject: one for achievement and the otl1er for effort, improvement, or growth. An example of a high school report form used for multiple grading is shown in Figure 15.1 The report fonn in the figure uses separate grades for achievement, effort, and ratings on two lists of objectives. On tl1e left side is a list of common school objectives appearing on all the report forms. The list of objectives on the right side is of those pertaining to the palticular subject being graded, in this case social studies. This report form makes it possible to assign an ad1ievement grade that solely measures achievement because effOit and otl1er personal characteristics are graded separately. It also infonns both the student and parents of the progress being made toward the school's objectives and each subject's objectives. This report form was developed by
                                                                                ![](_page_384_Picture_1.jpeg)                         |

A comprehensive report form that combines dual grading and checklists of objectives

committees of students, parents, teachers, and other school personnel and thus reflects the types of information these groups considered most useful.

##### **Guidelines for Developing a Multiple Grading and Reporting System**

No grading and reporting system is likely to be equally satisfactory in all schools. Each sel1001 system must develop methods that fit its particular needs and circumstances. The following printiples for devising a multiple grading and reporting system are gUidelines for this purpose.

**1.** The development of the grading and repOt1iog system should be guided by the functions to be served. The type of information most needed by the repOlt's users should be included. This typically requires a study of the functions for which the reports are to be used by students, parents, teachers, counselors, and administrators. Although it is seldom possible to meet all their needs, a satisfactory compromise is more likely if they are known. It is helpful to supplement letter grades in each subject with separate reports on course objectives, effort, personal and social characteristics, and work habits. The letter grade should be retained as a pure measure of achievement, and any grades for improvement, effott, or growth should be made separately.

2. TIle grading and reporting system should be developed cooperatively by parents, students, and scbool personnel. School reports are apt to be most useful when all users have some voice in their development. This is usually done by organizing a committee conSisting of representatives of parent groups, student organizations, elementary and secondary school teachers, counselors, and administrators. Ideas and suggestions are fed into the committee through the representatives, and the members carry back to their own respective groups, for modification and final approval, the committee's tentative plans. This cooperative participation not only will result in a more adequate reporting system but also increases the likelihood that the reports will be understood by those for whom they are intended.

3. The grading and reporting system should be based on a clear statement of educational objectives. The same objectives that have guided instruction and assessment should selve as a basis for grading and repolting. Some of these will be general school objectives, and others will be unique to palticular courses or areas of study. Nevertheless, when devising a reporting system, the first question should be, How can we best report student progress toward these particular objectives? The final report form will be limited and modified by a number of practical considerations, but the central focus should be on the objectives of the school and course and the types of performance that represent the achievement of these objectives.

4. n1e grading and reporting system should be consistent with school standards. Schools and districts that are implementing content and performance standards need to review grading polities in light of those standards. The grading system needs to be aligned with the performance standards if it is to SUPPOlt rather than undermine the implementation of dl0se standards. Use of the same categories for grades and performance standards is one obvious step. There is also a need, however, to align the performances that students are expected to achieve with the verbal descriptions of the performance standards.

5. The grading and reporting system should be based on adequate assessment. Teachers should not be expected to report on aspects of student performance when evidence is lacking or is unreliable. By the same token, including items on a report form assumes that the performance will be assessed as objectively as possible. Ratings on such items as o'itical thinking, for example, should be the product of testing, assessment, and controlled observation rather than snap judgments or hazy recollections of incidental happenings. Therefore, in planning a grading and reporting system, it is necessary to take into account the types of assessment data needed. The items included in the final report form should be those on which teachers can obtain reasonably reliable and valid information. The validity and reliability of the grade is directly determined by the reliability and validity of the items constituting the grade as well as having a reasonable number of items to determine the grade.

6. The grading and reporting system should be detailed enough to be diagnostic and yet compact enough to be practical. For gUiding students' learning and development, we should present as comprehensive a picture of their strengths and weaknesses as possible. This desire for detail, however, must be balanced by such practical demands as (a) a reasonable amount of time required to prepare and use the reports; (b) reports that are understandable to students, parents, school and college or university personnel, and employers; and Cc) reports that are easily surnrnarized for school records. As noted eariier, a compromise between comprehensiveness and practicaiity is probably best obtained by supplementing the letter-grade system with more detailed repOlts on other aspects of student development.

7. The grading and reporting system should provide for parent-teacher conferences as needed. At the elementalY school level, regulal'ly sd1eduled conferences with parents might constitute part of the reporting system. At the high school level, such conferences are typically arranged as needed to deal with specific problems. At both levels, however, such conferences should supplement a more formal report form rather than replace it. A uniform method of reporting student progress is needed for scl100l records, and this is difficult to obtain from conference notes.

In SUlIl1nalY, a multiple grading and reporting system takes into account the varied needs of students, parents, teachers, and other school personnel. The letter-grade system CA, B, C, D, F) provides a simplified method of keeping a record of student achievement. The checklist of objectives provides a detailed report of student strengths and weaknesses in learning and development. The carefully constructed portfolio provides concrete examples of both progress and level of achievement. The parem--teacher conference helps maintain cooperation between home and school. When letter grades are supplemented by these other methods of reporting, the grades become more meaningful. Rather than being a conglomerate of achievement, effort, improvement, and personal behaVior, letter grades can be confined to measuring achievement only. Multiple grading makes this possible by repolting separately on the other aspects of student development.

#### ASSIGNING LETTER GRADES

Because most schools use the A, B, C, D, F grading system, most teachers will be faced with the problem of assigning letter grades. This involves questions such as the following:

- 1. What should be included in a letter grade?
- 2. How should achievement data be combined in assigning letter grades?
- 3. What frame of reference should be used in grading?
- 4. How should the distribution of letter grades be determined?

Each of these issues is discussed in turn.

##### Determining What to Include in a Grade

As noted earlier, letter grades are likely to be most meaningful and useful when they represent achievement only. If they are contaminated by such extraneous factors as effort, amount of work completed (rather than quality of the work), personal conduct, and so on, their interpretation will become hopelessly confused. When letter grades combine various aspects of student development, they lose their meaningfulness as a measure of achievement and suppress other important aspects of development. A letter grade of B, for example, may represent average achievement with outstanding effort and excellent conduct or high achievement with little effort and some disciplinary infractions. Only by making the letter grade as pure a measure of achievement as possible and reporting on these other aspects separately can we hope to improve our descriptions of student learning and development.

Teachers often are comfortable with the notion that grades should be based strictly on achievement for students that they judge to be highly able; but they believe that effort should be considered along with achievement for students whom they judge to be less able (Stiggins, Frisbie, & Griswold, 1989). Although this position seems reasonable on the surface, it has some major drawbacks: (a) It is difficult, if not impossible, for a teacher to adequately assess a student's effort or potential; (b) it is difficult to distinguish between aptitude and achievement even with the most sophisticated measures, as both depend on student learning; and (c) using different bases of grading for different students sends a mixed message and may be unfair to students who are perceived as being more able than they are.

If letter grades are to be valid indicators of achievement, they must be based on valid measures of achievement. This involves the process described earlier in this bookdefining the course objectives as intended learning outcomes and developing or selecting tests and assessments that measure these outcomes most directly. How much emphasis should be given to tests, ratings of performances, written reports, and other measures of achievement in the letter grades is determined by the nature of the course and the objectives being stressed. Thus, a grade in English might be determined largely by tests and writing projects, a grade in science by tests and assessments of laboratory performance, and a grade in music by tests and ratings on performance skills. The types of assessment data to include in a course grade and the relative emphasis to be given to each type of evidence are determined primarily by examining the instructional objectives. Other things being equal, the more important an objective is, the greater the weight it should receive in the course grade. **In** the final analysis, letter grades should reflect the extent to which students have achieved the learning outcomes specified in the course objectives, and these should be weighted according to their relative importance.

##### **Combining Data in Assigning Grades**

When the aspects of achievement (e.g., tests, written reports, or pe1formance ratings) to be included in a letter grade and the emphasis to be given to each aspect have been decided, the next step is to combine the various elements so that each element receives its intended weight. If we decide, for example, that the final examination should count 40%, the midterm 30%, laboratolY performance 20%, and written reports 10%, then we will want our course grades to reflect these emphases. A typical procedure is to combine the elements into a composite score by assigning appropriate weights to each element and then use these composite scores as a basis for grading.

Combining data into a composite score to produce the desired weighting is not as simple as it may appear at first glance. This can be illustrated by a simple example. Let us assume that we want to combine scores on a final examination and a telm report and that we want them to be given equal weight. Our range of scores on the two measures is as follows:

Range of Scores

Final examination    80 to 100 
Term report          10 to 50

In practice, we would want to combine more than two assessment results before assigning grades, but the use of just two elements is sufficient for illustration. Because the two sets of scores are to be given equal weight, we may be inclined simply to add together the final examination score and the term report score for eacll student. We can check on the effectiveness of this procedure by comparing the composite score of a student who is highest on the final examination and lowest on the term report (100 + 10 = 110) with a student who is lowest on the final exa.mination and highest on the term report (80 + 50 130). It is obvious from this comparison that simply adding together the two scores will not give them equal representation.

Another common but erroneous method of equating scores is to make the maximum possible scores the same for both sets of scores. For our scores, this would mean multiplying the scores on the telm report by 2, so that the top score on both measures would equal 100. Applying this procedure to the same two extreme cases we considered earlier, our first student would have a score of 120 (100 + 20) and our second smdent a score of 180 (80 + 100). It is obvious that this procedure does not equate the scores. In fact, there is now an even larger difference between the two composite scores, because the influence each component has on the composite score depends on the variability, or spread, of scores, not on the total number of points. Thus, to properly weight the components in a composite score, the variability of the scores must be taken into account.

The range of scores in our example provides a measure of score variability, or spread, and this can be used to give the two sets of scores comparable weight. We can give the

final examination and the term report equal weight in the composite score by using a multiplier that makes the two ranges equal. Because the final examination scores have a range of 20 (100 - 80) and the term report scores a range of 40 (50 - 10), we would need to multiply each final examination score by 2 to obtain the desired equal weight. Note that this weighting is the reverse of the incorrect weighting procedure based on making the maximum possible scores equal. We can check on the effectiveness of this procedure by using the same two cases we considered earlier. The student highest on the final examination and lowest on the term report would now have a score of 210 (200 + 10), and the student lowest on the final examination and highest on the term report would also have a score of 210 (160 + 50). Our check shows that the procedure gives the two sets of scores equal weight in the composite score. If we wanted our final examination to count twice as much as the term report, it would be necessary to multiply each final examination score by 4 rather than by 2.

A more refined weighting system can be obtained by using the standard deviation as the measure of variability. For teachers with access to computers, this is a simple matter of converting scores on each test or assessment to T-scores (see Chapter 19). The T-scores can then be multiplied by whatever weights are desired and summed to yield a composite

x = raw score, M = mean, S = standard deviation

Note that Bob and Carla have the same weighted composite T-score and that Casey has a slightly higher weighted composite T-score than Eva. If the difference in standard deviations had been ignored and the same weights were applied to raw scores, the weighted composite raw scores would give Bob a higher score (32.4) than Carla (29.2)

because he had his best pelformance on the component with the largest standard deviation, whereas she had her best performance on the component with the smallest standard deviation. Consider why Casey's weighted composite raw score (51.6) is slightly lower than .Eva's (52), but their T-scores show tlle opposite pattern.

score for which grades are assigned (see the box "Using T-Scores to Compute Composite Scores"). Using T-scores or other ways of converting scores to account for differences in standard deviations can easily be accomplished with a personal computer and specialized software described later in this chapter that is designed for purposes of grading. However, the range is satisfactory for most classroom purposes.

##### Selecting the Proper Frame of Reference for Grading

Letter grades are typically assigned on the basis of one of the following frames of reference:

- 1. Performance in relation to other group members (relative grading)
- 2. Performance in relation to specified standards (absolute grading)
- 3. Performance in relation to learning ability or amount of improvement

Assigning grades on a relative basis involves comparing a student's performance with that of a reference group, typically one's classmates. With this system, the grade is determined by the student's relative ranking in the total group rather than by some absolute standard of achievement. Because the grading is based on relative performance, the grade is influenced by both the student's performance and the performance of the group. Thus, one will fare much better, gradewise, in a low-achieving group than in a high-achieving group.

Although relative grading has the disadvantage of a shifting frame of reference (i.e., grades depend on the group's ability), it is widely used in the schools because much of classroom testing is norm referenced. That is, the tests are designed to rank students in order of achievement rather than to describe achievement in absolute terms. Although position in the group is the key element in a relative system of grading, the actual grades assigned are also likely to be influenced to some extent by achievement expectations the teacher has acquired from teaching other groups. Thus, a high-achieving group of students is likely to receive a larger proportion of good grades than a low-achieving group.

The disadvantages of relative grading are particularly evident in high school, where higher-achieving students may enroll in more challenging advanced or honors courses. Achievement slightly below the class average in an advanced or honors course may actually be equal to or better than that of the highest-ranking student in another, less demanding course in the same subject. It is both misleading and unfair to give the former student a C while the latter student receives an A. Some states have given formal recognition to the more demanding nature of honors courses. Rather than converting letter grades of A, B, C, and D to numerical values of 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, for computing grade-point averages, as would be done for a typical course, honors course grades would be converted to values of 5, 4, 3, and 2. Another approach with relative grading that gives appropriate recognition to student self-selection and the more demanding nature of advanced and honors courses is simply to give a larger percentage of As and Bs in those courses than in typical courses.

Assigning grades on an absolute basis involves comparing a student's performance to specified standards set by the teacher, preferably in reference to agreed-on performance standards for the school and/ or district. These standards may be concerned with the degree of mastery to be achieved by students and may be specified as (a) tasks to be performed (e.g., type 40 words per minute without error) or (b) the percentage of correct answers to be obtained on a test designed to measure a clearly defined set of learning tasks. In recent years, Scllool, district, or even state perfonnance standards have been adopted and are intended to guide the absolute judgments about whether a student's record of performance meets the established standards.

With a standards-based system, letter grades are assigned on the basis of an absolute standard of pelformance rather than a relative one. If all sUldents demonstrate a high level of mastelY consistent with the established performance standards, then aU will receive high grades.

The absolute grading required for a standard-based reporting system is much more complex than it first appears. To use absolute level of achievement as a basis for grading requires that (a) the domain of learning tasks be clearly defined, (b) the standards of performance be clearly specified and justified, and (c) the measures of student achievement be criterion referenced. These conditions are difficult to meet except in a mastery learning situation. When complete mastelY is the goal, the learning tasks tend to be more limited and easily defined. In addition, percentage-correct scores, which are widely used in setting absolute standards, are most meaningful in mastery learning because they indicate how far a student is from complete mastery. All too frequently, schools use absolute grading based on percentage-correct scores (e.g., A ~ 95-100, B ~ 85- 94, C ~ 75-84, D ~ 65-74, F ~ below 65), but the domain of learning tasks has not been clearly defined and the standards have been set in a completely arbitrary manner. To fit the grading system, teachers attempt to build norm-referenced tests with scores in the 60 to 100 range. If the test turns out to be too difficult or too easy, they adjust the scores to fit the absolute grading scale. But such grades are difficult to interpret because they represent an adjusted level of performance, often with an ill-defined adjustment procedure, on some ill-defined conglomerate of learning tasks.

Although reporting student performance in relation to learning ability or amount of improvement shown is fairly widespread at the elementary school level, it is inconsistent with a standards-based system of evaluating and reporting student perfoffilance. Moreover, grading in relationship to student ability or in terms of student improvement is fraught with difficulties. Making reliable estimates of learning ability, with or without tests, is a formidable task because judgments or measurements of ability are likely to be contaminated by achievement to some unknown degree, similarly improvement  (i.e., growth in achievement) over short spans of time is extremely difficult to estimate reliably with classroom measures of achievement. TIlliS, the lack of reliability in judging achievement in relation to ability and in judging degree of improvement will result in grades of low dependability. If used at all (e.g. , to motivate low-ability students), such grades should be supplementary. In dual grading, for example, one letter grade might indicate level of achievement (relative or absolute), and the second letter grade might be used to represent achievement in relation to ability or the degree of improvement shown since the last grading period.

##### **Determining the Distribution of Grades**

N; noted in the previous section, there are two ways of assigning letter grades to measure the level of snldent achievement: the relative grading system based on relative level of achievement and the absolute grading system based on absolute level of achievement.

Relath'e Gradiog. The assignment of relative grades is essentially a matter of ranking the students in order of overall achievement and assigning letter grades on the basis of each student's rank in the group. This ranking might be limited to a single classroom group or might be based on the combined distributions of several classroom groups taking the same course. In any event, before letter grades can be assigned, the proportion of As , Bs, Cs, Ds, and Fs to be used must be determined.

Although dearly inconsistent with cunent efforts to introduce and use standards-based grading and reporting systems, one method of grading that has been widely used in the past and is still used in some schools is to assign grades on the basis of the normal curve. Grading on the nOlmal CUlve results in an equal percentage of As and Fs and Bs and Ds. Thus, regardless of the group's level of ability, the propoltion of high grades is balanced by an equal proportion of low grades. Such grading is seldom defensible for classroom groups because (a) the groups are usually too small to yield a nonnal distribution and (b) classroom assessment instruments are usually not designed to yield normally distributed scores. It is only when a course or combined courses have a relatively large and unselected group of snldents that grading on the normal CUlve might be defended . Even, then, however, one might ask whether the decision concerning the distribution of grades should be left to a statistical model (e.g., normal curve) or should be made on a more rational basis.

If "grading on the CUlve" is to be used, the most sensible approach in determining the distribution of letter grades to be used in a school is to have the school staff set general guidelines for the approximate distribution of grades. TI1is might involve separate distributions for introductory and advanced courses, for gifted and remedial classes, and the like. In any event, the distributions should be flexible enough to allow for variation in the performance of students from one course to another and from one time to another in the same course. Indicating ranges rather than fixed percentages of students who should receive each letter grade offers this flexibility. Thus, a suggested disu'ibution for an inUUduCt01Y course might be stated as follows:

- A = 10% to 20% of the students
- B = 20% to 30% of the students
- C = 30% to 50% of the students
- o = 10% to 2()O/o of the students
- F = 0% to 10% of the students

These percentage ranges are presented for illustrative purposes only; there is no simple or scientific means of determining what these ranges should be for a given situation. The decision must be made by the local school staff, taking into account the Sd100l'S philosophy, the student population, and the purposes of the grades. All staff members must understand the basis for aSSigning grades, and this basis must be clearly communicated to users of the grades.

In setting an approximate distIibution of grades for teachers to follow, the distlibution should provide for the possibility of *no* failing grades. Whether students pass or fail a course should be based on their absolute level of learning rather than their relative position in some group. If all low-ranking students have mastered enough of the material to succeed at the next-higher level of instnlction, they all probably should pass. On the other hand, if some have not mastered the minimum essentials needed at the next-higher level, these students probably should fail. Whether minimum performance has been attained can be determined by reviewing the low-ranking students' performance on tests and other assessment instruments or by administeIing a special mast elY test on the course's minimum essentials. Thus, even when grading is done on a relative basis, the pass-fail decision must be based on an absolute standard of adlievement if it is to be educationally sound.

Absolute Grading. If the course's objectives have been clearly specified and the standards for mastelY appropIiately set, the letter grades in an absolute system may be defined as the degree to which the objectives have been attained, as follows:

- A = Outstanding. Student has mastered all the course's major and minor instructional goals.
- B = VelY good. Student has mastered all the course's major instructional goals and most of the minor ones.
- C = Satisfactoly. Student has mastered all the course's major instructional goals but just a few of the minor ones.
- D = VelY weak. SUI dent has mastered just a few of the course's major and minor instructional goals and barely has the essentials needed for the next highest level of instruction. Remedial work would be desirable.
- F = Unsatisfactory. Student has not mastered any of the course's major instructional goals and lacks the essentials needed for the next highest level of instruction. Remedial work is needed.

If the tests and other assessment instruments have been designed to yield scores in terms of the percentage of correct answers, absolute grading then might be defined as follows:

- A = 95% to 100% con'ect
- B = 85% to 94% correct
- C = 75% to 84% correct
- D = 65% to 74% correct
- F = below 65% correct

It should be emphasized, however, that it is a nontlivial task to design a test such that these ranges or any other prespecified ranges will correspond to the intended standards of performance for those grades.

As noted earlier, defining letter grades in this manner is defensible only if the necessary conditions of an absolute grading system have been met. Using percentage-correct scores when the measuring instruments are based on some undefined hodgepodge of learning tasks produces uninterpretable grades.

With absolute grading systems such as these, the distribution of grades is not predetermined. If all students demonstrate a high level of mastery, all will receive high grades. If some students demonstrate a low level of performance, they will receive low grades. See the "Guidelines" box.

The absolute grading system for reporting on student progress seldom uses letter grades alone. A comprehensive report generally includes a checklist of objectives to inform both student and parent which objectives have been mastered and which have not been mastered by the end of each grading period. In some standards-based programs, letter grades (or numbers) are assigned to eacl1 objective or benchmark associated with a content standard to indicate the level of proficiency that has been achieved. An example of such a report form, designed for use in a middle school, is shown in Figure 15.2. This form is designed for reporting on benchmarks at the middle school level associated with one of the six Colorado Model Content Standards for Mathematics. A numerical rating is assigned to each objective as follows:
 
 Has Acquired Proficiency
- 4 = Skill well developed, good proficiency
- 3 = Skill developed satisfactorily, proficiency could be improved
- 2 = Basic skill developed, low profidency, needs additional work

 Not Acquired
1 = Basic skill not acquired

As with other types of absolute grading, the number of *Is, 2s, 3s,* and 4s to be assigned to each benchmark associated with the standard is not predetermined but depends entireiy

 GUIDELINES : Effective Grading

- 1. Describe your grading procedures to students at the beginning of instruction.
- 2. Make clear to students that the course grade will be based on acl1ievement only.
- 3. Explain how other elements (effort, work habits, and personal-sodal characteristics) will be repOIted.
- 4. Relate the grading procedures to the intended learning outcomes (Le. , instructional goals and objectives).
- 5. Obtain valid evidence (e.g. , tests, assessments, reports, or ratings) as a basis for assigning grades.
- 6. Take precautions to prevent cheating on tests and assessments.
- 7. Return and review all test and assessment results as soon as possible.
- 8. Properly weight the various types of achievement included in the grade.
- 9. Do not lower an achievement grade for tardiness, weak effort, or misbehavior.
- 10. Be fair. Avoid bias, and when in doubt (as with a borderline score), review the evidence. If still in doubt, assign the higher grade.

#### **RECORD-KEEPING AND GRADING SOFTWARE**

Gradebooks have been a familiar palt of teadting for many decades. Although that is as true in the 21st century as it was at the stalt of the 20th, the form of the grade book has undergone substantial change as electronic gradebooks replace or supplement the familiar notebook-style paper gradebook.

Although any simple spreadsheet can be used as a grade book, a host of specialized software is available that is designed to facilitate the common tasks of recording and combining grades. Most computer grade book software is based on an underlying spreadsheet design. The software may have templates to aid in data entry and simple

procedures for specifying rules for combining grades from several sources, such as homework, tests, assessments, and projects. The software also provides various options for printing, reporting, and summarizing results. Sometimes the gradebook software may be linked to software designed to perfonn other functions, such as test construction, item banking, test administration, or keeping attendance.

A listing of a few examples of gradebook software programs is provided in the box "Examples of Gradebook Computer Software." The list is not exhaustive but provides a range of examples. Because existing software is constantly being updated and new software is added on a regular basis, a search of the Internet is a good way to bring such a list up to date and learn about new options. A brief ovelview written by Sherril Steele-Carlin is available on the Education World Web site at http://www.education-world.comJ a\_techitech031.shtml.

#### **CONDUCTING PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES**

Regardless of the type of grading and repOlting system used in the school, the parent-teacher conference is an important supplement to the written repolt of student progress. The face-to-face conference makes it possible to share information with parents (or guardians), to overcome any misunderstanding between home and school, and to plan cooperatively a program of maximum benefit to the student. At the elementary sd1001 level, where parent-teacher cooperation is palticularly impOltant, conferences with parents are regularly scheduled. At the secondary level, the parent-teacher conference is typically used only when some special problem situation arises.

 Examples of Gradebook Computer Software

Conferences with parents are most likely to be productive when they are preceded by careful planning and the teacher has skill in conducting such conferences. Many SdlOOls offer in-service training for teachers to help them develop effective conference techniques. Typically, SUd1 training indudes knowledge of how to conduct a parent-teacher conference and role playing to practice the use of conference skills. The following points provide helpful reminders when preparing for and conducting parent-tead1er conferences.

1. Make plans for the conference. Determine ahead of time the goals of the conference. Your main purpose may be to inform parents of their student's progress, but you may also want to obtain information from parents, make suggestions for home study, or discuss how to solve a particular problem. It is helpful to review the student's record, organize the information you are going to present, and make a list of points you want to cover and questions you plan to ask. Portfolios can provide a good basis for highlighting topics for discussion, but only if the entries are carefully selected and reviewed.

2. Begin the conference in a positive manner. Statting the conference by making a positive statement about the student sets the tone for the meeting. Saying something like "Kimberly really enjoys helping others," "Ruben is an expert on dinosaurs, " or "Marie is always smiling" tends to create a cooperative and friendly atmosphere. Once established, this positive attitude should be maintained throughout the conference.

3. Present tbe student's strong points before describing areas needing improvement. It is helpful to present examples of the student'S work when discussing the student's performance. A brief review of portfolio entries before the conference is helpful in identifying appropriate examples. The work examples help keep the focus on what the student can do and what he or she has yet to learn. Showing a mathematics test to a parent is much more effective than simply saying the student "does addition problems well but has difficulty with division problems" or "is good with simple computation but needs help with story problems." Similarly, showing examples of an essay written in September alongside one written the following Febmary makes the statement that the student'S writing "has shown great improvement" much more concrete.

4. Encourage parents to participate and share information. Although as a teacher you are in charge of the conference, you must be willing to listen to parents and share information rather than "talk at" them. They may have questions and concerns about the school and about their child's behavior that need to be brought out before constmctive, cooperative action can be taken.

5. Plan a course of action cooperatively. The discussion should lead to what steps can be taken by the teacher and the parent to help the student. A brief summary at the end of the conference should review the points discussed and the action to be taken at home and school.

6. End the conference with a positive comment. At the end of the conference, thank the parents for coming and say something positive about the student, such as "Noah has a good sense of humor, and I enjoy having him in dass. " Any such statement should, of course, fit the student and not be a vague generality that is used repeatedly.

7. Use good human relations skills during the conference. Some of these skills can be summarized by the following **do's** and **don'ts.** 

 Do's
- Be friendly and informal.
- Be positive in your approach.
- Be willing to explain in understandable terms.
- Be willing to listen.
- Be willing to accept parents' feelings.
- Be careful about giving advice.

 Don'ts
- Don't argue or get angry.
- Don't ask embarrassing questions.
- Don't talk about other students, teachers, or parents.
- Don't bluff if you don't know an answer.
- Don't reject parents' suggestions.
- Don't be a know-it-all, with pat answers.

Although one cannot expect to conduct an effective conference by reading about how to do it, these points serve as a helpful reminder of things to do and to avoid when prepaIing for a conference.

#### **REPORTING STANDARDIZED TEST RESULTS TO PARENTS**

Standardized test results are sometimes reported to parents duIing a parent- teacher conference. Although parents may have a legal right to all information the school has concerning their children, it should be presented to them in an understandable and usable form. This means avoiding technical jargon and presenting test results to parents in language that is meaningful to them. There also will be less chance of misunderstanding and more chance of being viewed in proper perspective if the test results are presented as part of the total pattern of information about the student.

In preparing to report to parents, review the test results and decide when and how they will be introduced into the conference. The meaningful communication of test results to parents includes the following:

- 1. Describing what the test measures
- 2. Explaining the meaning of test scores
- 3. Clalifying the accuracy of test scores
- 4. Discussing the use of test results

The amount of detail you give in each of these areas will, of course, depend on the time available for the conference and the parents' depth of understanding of the test results. In general, it is best to keep the explanations brief and Simple. Do not overwhelm parents with more test information than they can grasp in the short span of time that is typically available for presenting test information.

##### **Describing What the Test Measures**

In reporting on the results of an aptitude or learning ability test, saying something like "This test measures skills and abilities useful in school learning" may be sufficient. If the test contains several scores (e.g., verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal), each section of the test may be described in similarly general terms. Test manuals usually contain general descriptions of the tests and subtests that can be used to e},,'Plain the test to parents. The following list of things to avoid should help prevent misinterpretation.

- 1. Do not refer to aptitude or learning ability tests as intelligence tests. The term *intelligence* is emotionally charged and often misunderstood.
- 2. Do not describe aptitude or learning ability tests as measures of fixed abilities. They are not! They measure learned abilities.
- 3. Do not say, "These test scores predict how well your dlild will do in school. " They won't! Predictions for individuals are hazardous at best, and many factors detennine school success. It is better to say something like "Students with scores like these usually do well in school" or, for low scores, " .. . usually find learning difficult."

Achievement tests are easily described in terms of the test content, and the names of the subtests usually indicate what the test measures. To say that a reading test measures "vocabulary and reading comprehension" or that a math test measures "computation and problem solving" is frequently sufficient. In some cases, it may be desirable to describe the test results by objective or item dusters, and these are typically identified on the student's individual report form. When narrative report forms are used, the test content is induded as part of the narrative report.

Interpretations of vocational interest inventories, personality inventories, and otller guidance-oriented assessment devices al'e best interpreted by the school counselor or other guidance personnel. Parents should be referred to the appropriate staff member if they have questions about scores on these instnlments.

##### **Explaining the Meaning** of Test **Scores**

More detailed discussion of standardized tests and the meaning of various types of scores are provided in Chapters 16 tllroUgh 19. In this section, we simply provide a broad overview of issues in explaining standal'dized test results to parents. In making nOIIDreferenced interpretations of test scores, both the meaning of the score and the nature of tlle norm group should be explained to parents, bOtll simply and understandably. Percentile ranks, grade-equivalent scores, and stanines are widely used in reporting to parents because tlley are easy to explain and misinterpretations are less likely to occur. Saying sometlling like the following will usually suffice with tllese scores.

Figure 15.3 shows the relation of stanines, percentile ranks, and broad verbal deso'iptions tllat can be used in reporting to parents.

It is wise to repolt all test results in terms of the same type of score (e.g., percentile ranks, grade eqUivalents, or stanines). This makes it easier to explain the scores to parents and makes comparisons among tests more tmderstandable.

Although parents are interested in how their child 's test performance compares with that of other children, they also want to know what the child has learned and has yet to EXAMPLES Interpreting percentile ranks: ''On the reading vocabulary test, Mary scored higher than 85% of a national group of fourth-grade students." (It might also be necessary to point out that the 85% refers not to the percentage of items answered correctly but only to the percentage of students scoring lower.)

> Interpreting grade-equivalent scores: 'On the reading vocabulary test, Mary scored as well as the typical student in a national group did in the spring of the fifth grade. That is well above the national average for fourth-grade students. The score does not necessarily mean that Mary can do all aspects of fifth-grade work, however, only that she does fourth-grade work better than most in the fourth grade and about as well as the typical fifth-grade student."

> Interpreting stanines: "On a scale of 1 to 9, on which the average score is 5, Mary received a score of 7 on the reading vocabulary test, when compared with a national group of fourth-grade students." (In some cases it may be desirable to use verbal descriptions such as above average [7,8,9), average [4,5,6], or below average [1, 2, 3] in place of numbers.)

learn. This type of criterion-referenced interpretation is more readily understood by parents and is typically reported in terms of relative degree of mastety. If you use percentage-correct scores, you may want to distinguish between percentile scores and percentage-correct scores. If you use mastery-nonmastery designations, describe the standard of mastery and explain how it was determined.

Relation of stanines, percentile ranks, and broad verbal descriptions in a normal distribution

##### **Clarifying the Accuracy** of Test **Scores**

It is impol1ant to communicate to parents that all test scores contain some error. This can be done most easily if confidence bands (Le., error bands) are used in interpreting test scores. Profiles using percentile rank frequently include confidence bands. If these are not available, percentile ranks should be interpreted as estimates that may vary up or down by several points on retesting.

Stanines contain broad units that allow for measurement error. Because each stanine is at least half a standard deviation wide, a difference of two stanines usually represents a significant difference in test performance.

Thus, if we had scores such as these,

| Mathematics | 8 |
|-------------|---|
| Reading     | 6 |
| Science     | 5 |

we could make the following interpretation: "Performance is higher in mathematics than reading and science, but there is no real difference in performance between reading and science." Parents should be told that a difference of 1 stanine is so small that it can be accounted for by errors of measurement alone.

When interpreting test results by objective or by item cluster, attention should be paid to the number of items on which each interpretation is based. If the number of items is small (say less than 10), make only tentative interpretations and explain to the parents that these are simply clues to be verified by futther study. When combined with the results of teacher-made tests and other classroom work, more dependable interpretations may be possible. It is always good practice to interpret test scores to parents in light of tlle other available data concerning the student.

##### **Discussing the Use of Test Results**

The interpretation of test results should be accompanied by an explanation of how the test results are to be used in the instructional program and a discussion of what action should be taken by both teacller and parent to improve the student's learning and development. This discussion, of course, should not be limited to the test results but should be based on all the evidence concerning the student's learning and development. The value of test scores becomes clearer to parents when they are coordinated with all the other information about the student and when they are seen as contributing to plans for constructive action.

#### **SUMMARY**

School grades and progress reports serve various functions in the school. They provide information that is helpful to students, parents, and school personnel. Students find dlem useful as summary appraisals of learning progress that serve somewhat the same functions as other assessment results. Parents, teachers, and counselors use the information in guiding learning and development and in helping students make realistic future plans.

Administrators use the information to determine promotion, athletic eligibility, honors, and graduation. The reports also provide a basis for reporting to other schools, to colleges and universities, and to prospective employers.

The diverse functions of progress reports make it difficult to find a universally satisfactory reporting method. Some of the methods that have been tried include (a) the traditional grading system (e.g. , A, B, C, D, F), (b) the pass-fail system, (c) checklists of objectives, (d) informal letters, (e) pOltfolios of selected examples of student work, and (0 parent-teacher conferences. Each method has rather severe limitations when used alone. Probably the best reporting system combines a concise grade for administrative functions with a more detailed repOlt and portfolio for teaching and guidance purposes. In any event, some combination of methods seems most appropriate.

The letter-grade system of grading (A, B, C, D, F) continues to be the most widely used system at both the elementary and secondary levels despite attempts to replace it with a more meaningful report. This is probably because such grades are easily assigned and averaged and serve many useful administrative functions. Thus, it seems sensible to retain letter grades as a pure measure of acllievement and to supplement them with more detailed and meaningful reports of learning progress. Such a multiple grading and reporting system should be developed cooperatively by parents, students, teachers, and other school personnel. Efforts should be made to develop a system that is in harmony with the functions to be served, the school's objectives, and the assessment data available. Ideally, the report form should be as comprehensive and detailed as is practical and should be supplemented by parent-teacher conferences as needed.

Whether or not a multiple grading and repolting system is used in a school, most teachers will be responsible for assigning letter grades to students. This involves such considerations as detemlining what to include in the letter grade, how to combine the various achievement data into a composite, what frame of reference to use, and what distribution of letter grades to use. The letter grade is most likely to provide a meaningful measure of achievement when (a) it reflects the extent to which students have attained the learning outcomes specified in the instructional goals and objectives, (b) it is based on valid measures of achievement, and (c) each component of achievement is weighted in tenns of its relative impoltance. Assigning weights to eacll component requires that the variability (Le., spread) of scores be taken into account.

Letter grades may be used to indicate a student's relative level of achievement or absolute level of achievement. When assigning relative grades, the normal curve is seldom an appropriate model for determining the distribution of grades. A more sensible approach is to have the school staff set up suggested distributions of grades that take into account the school's philosophy, the student population, the nature of the course (e.g., whether it is an advanced or honors course), and the purposes to be served by the grades. Attention should be given to ensuring that the grades are aligned with and contribute to performance standards adopted by the school or district. In absolute grading, the letter grades represent the degree to which the performance standards have been acllieved. With this system, no predetermined distribution of letter grades is specified. If all students achieve a high degree of profidency, all will receive high grades.

Even when students are assigned grades on a relative basis, the pass-fail decision should be based on a student's absolute level of acllievement. The important consideration is whether the student has the minimum knowledge and skills needed to succeed at the next-highest level of instruction.

Letter grades are sometimes assigned on the basis of performance in relation to learning ability or amount of improvement. The problems of adequately judging learning ability apart from achievement and of reliably measuring learning gain over short spans of time restrict the use of these grading methods. If used at all (e.g., for motivation purposes), such grades should supplement grades based on the student's relative or absolute level of achievement.

Parent-teacher conferences are an important method of sharing information with parents. Such conferences should supplement the more formal written report of student progress, however, rather than replace it. Effective conferences with parents require careful planning and sound conference techniques. Portfolios of student work can help make both student progress and level of achievement concrete for parents. Because repolts of standardized test results also may be expected to be part of some conferences, tead1ers should know how to report test results to parents. Although gUidelines are useful in preparing for conferences with parents, in-service training is usually needed to develop adequate conference skills.

## **PART III**  *Selecting and Using Published Tests*

### CHAPTER 16: ACHIEVEMENT TESTS**

There are hundreds of published achievement tests available for use. Some consist of a battery of tests, whereas others measure an individual subject or skill; some provide a general survey of learning olltcomes, whereas others provide descriptive and diagnostic information. Some are off-the-shelf published tests; some are customized to specifications of state assessment programs. Becoming familiar with with these basic types of achievement tests and principles of selection and LIse should provide helpful guidelines for effective achievement testing.

Achievement testing plays an important role in the school program, and published achievement tests are widely used at both the elementary and secondary school levels. Most published achievement tests are called standardized achievement tests. These typically are norm-referenced tests that measure the students' level of achievement in various content and skill areas by comparing their test performance with the perfonnance of other students in some general reference group (e.g., a nationwide sample of students at the same grade level). Quite a few criterion-referenced achievement tests also have been published.

In recent years, a number of states and districts have introduced their own testing and assessment systems or have contracted with publishers to develop assessments to their specificatjons. The tests and assessments developed under contract are frequently customized with tl1e intent of aligTling with a state or district's content standards. Those customized tests may include elements of a pUblished test but are usually supplemented to cover tl1e content specified in the standards. Many of these assessments have included open-ended perfonnance assessment tasks. Test publishers also market writing assessments and other types of open-ended performance assessments as supplements to their standardized tests. Nevertheless, standardized tests are still widely used either as part of a broader assessment system or alone, in part because they provide an efficient and relatively inexpensive means of measuring broad acruevement goals. Hence, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these tests.

Although nonn-referenced achievement tests, criterion-referenced achievement tests, and tests customized to specific content standards can be considered distinct test types, test publishers often attempt to incorporate elements of each in the same test. For example, most newly developed standardized achievement tests provide for both norm-referenced interpretation and interpretation by objective or skill area. Some of the customized tests developed for states not only report results in terms of specified performance standards but also provide nonnative interpretations of results. Caution is needed when interpreting by objective or spedfic content standard, however, because standardized tests usually cover such a broad area of achievement that there may be relatively few items for each objective or skill being measured. On the other hand, some criterion-referenced achievement tests provide norms for fllrther interpretation.

Few teachers have the chance to make decisions to purchase a particular standardized test or to shape the requirements of a customized test developed under a state or district contract. Teachers may have an opportunity to be involved in committees that review off-the-shelf tests for district purchase or committees that review proposals from potential contractors to construct tests customized to content standards. Furthermore, almost all teachers are expected to administer the tests and participate in the lise and interpretation of the results. Thus, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these instmments and to know how to interpret the results that they provide.

We begin by examining the charaaeristics of norm-referenced standardized achievement tests and showing how they compare with teacher-made achievement tests. We then discuss the major types of published achievement tests used in schools. Although we give examples of some of the more widely used tests, there are many other published acheivement tests of high quality. We hope that the tests referred to here will simply serve as a starting point for exploring the many achievement tests available. At minimum, YOll should become familiar with some of the better published tests in your teaching area. See Appendix F for a selected list of published tests.

#### **CHARACTERISTICS OF STANDARDIZED ACHIEVEMENT TESTS**

A standardized achievement test has celtain distinctive fea tures, including a fixed set of test items designed to measure a clearly defined achievement domain, spedfic directions for administering and scoring the test, and norms based on representative groups of individuals like those for whom the test was designed. Standard content and procedure make it possible to give an identical test to individuals in different places at different times. The norms enable us to compare an individual's test score with those of known groups who also have taken the test. Thus, test norms provide a standard frame of reference for determining an individual's relative level of test perfonnance on a particular test and for comparing test performance on several different tests (provided that all were standardized on the same group).

EqUivalent forms are included in many standardized achievement tests, which make it possible to repeat the test without fear that the test takers will remember the answers from the first testing. Because eqUivalent forms of a test are built according to the same specifications, they measure the same domain of achievement with different sets of test items. They therefore can be used interd1angeably for such purposes as measuring educational growth, checking on questionable test results from an earlier testing, and the like.

Comparable forms are also induded in some standardized tests. These are forms that measure the same aspects of behavior bur at different grade levels. For example, one [on11 will cover grade 1, another form will cover grades 2 and 3, while other f01111S will cover grades 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 to 12. Such forms are especially useful for maintaining continuity of measurement in a Sd100lwide testing program or for studying 10ng-ten11 trends in educational growth.

The characteristics of a carefully constructed standardized achievement test include the following:

- 1. The test items are of a high technical quality. They have been developed by educational and test speCialists, tried our experimentally (pretested), and selected on the basis of difficulty, discriminating power, and relationship to a clearly defined and rigid set of specifications (see the box "How Publishers Select Test Items").
- 2. Directions for administering and scoring are so precisely stated that the procedures are standard for different users of the test.
- 3. N01111s based on national samples of students in the grades where the test is intended for use are provided as aids in interpreting the test scores. Separate norms are usually provided for different parts of the sdmol year (e.g., fall or spring). Norms for regions, states, or special groups, such as private schools, also might be supplied.
- 4. Equivalent and comparable forms of the test are usually provided, as is infOimation concerning the degree to which the forms are comparable.
- 5. A test manual and other accessOlY materials are included as guides for administering and scoring the test, evaluating its technical qualities, and interpreting and using the results.

Despite the common characteristics of standardized tests, no two are exactly alike. Ead1 test measures somewhat different aspects of content and skill. Also, there is wide variation in the completeness and quality of materials from one test to another. To fUlther complicate test selection, some tests with similar titles measure objectives that differ markedly. Thus, the intelligent selection of standardized ad1ievement tests from among the hundreds of tests available in each area requires studying the test content and tl1e test materials in light of the objectives to be measured and the uses to be made of the results.

#### **STANDARDIZED TESTS VERSUS INFORMAL CLASSROOM TESTS**

Standardized achievement tests and carefully constmcted classroom tests are similar in many ways. BOtl1 are based on a table of specifications, and both provide clear directions to the students. The main differences between tl1e two types are (a) the nature of the learning outcomes and content measured, (b) the quality of the test items, (c) the reliability

![](_page_408_Figure_1.jpeg)

of the tests, (d) the procedures for administering and (e) the interpretation of scores. Comparative advantages of standardized and informal classroom tests of achievement are shown in Table 16.1. A review of the comparative advantages of the two types of tests indicates that each is superior for certain purposes and inferior for others. The broader coverage of the standardized test, its more rigidly controlled procedures of administering and scoring, and the availability of norms for evaluating scores make it especially useful for the following instructional purposes.

1. Evaluating students' general educational skill development in those learning outcomes common to many courses of study

- 2. Evaluating student progress during the school year or over a period of years
- 3. Determining students' relative strengths and weaknesses in broad su bject or skill areas
- 4. Comparing students' general level of achievement with their scholastic aptitude

The standardized test's inflexibility makes it less valuable for those purposes for which the informal classroom test is so admirably suited.

- 1. Evaluating the learning outcomes and content unique to a particular class or Sclloo1
- 2. Evaluating students' day-ta-day progress and their achievement on work units of vacyillg sizes
- 3. Evaluating knowledge of cunent developments in rapidly cllanging content areas, such as science and social studies

The complementalY functions of the two types of tests indicate that both can contribute to a sound instructional program. Each provides a specific type of information regarding the students' educatio nal progress. In both cases, however, the value of the information depends on the extent to whicll the tests are related to the instructional objectives of the school and the ways in which the results are used. Standardized achievement tests, like informal classroom tests, can serve the many worthwhile instrudional pUlposes attributed to them only when they measure the particular outcomes and content deemed important by those responsible for the instructional program. **In** addition , the test results must be used appropriately.

Much of the criticism of standardized tests can be related to misuses of results. Too often standardized tests are expected to serve functions for which they were never intended or for which they are poorly suited. Rigid tracking of students based only on standardized test results, for example, places too much reliance on a single source of information and frequently results in inferior instructional opportunities for students placed in the lower tracks. Overemphasis on test results as a primary means of teacher accountability can also lead to distortions of instruction by nalTowing the clllTiculum to the content of the standardized tests at the expense of other important instructional goals that are not measured by the test.

#### **STANDARDIZED** ACHIEVEMENT TEST **BATTERIES**

Standardized adlievement tests are frequently llsed in the form of survey test batteries. A battery consists of a series of individual tests ali standardized on the same national sample of students. This makes it possible to compare test scores on the separate tests and thus determine the students' relative strengths and weaknesses in the different areas covered by tile test. With an elementary school test battery, for example, it is possible to determine that a student is strong in language skills but weak in mathematics skills, good in reading but less proficient in spelling and so on such comparisions are not possible with seperate tests that have been standardized on different groups of students because the base for comparison is not uniform.

The most widely used test batteries are published by three test publishers: CTBIMcGraw-Hill, Harcourt Educational Measurement, and Riverside Publishing Company. Each of these publishers offers an alTay of tests and assessments in addition to their major achievement test batteries. Some of those services are associated witll the main ad1ievement test batteries. Examples include aptitude tests normed together with the achievement test battery, a variety of supplements including written essay and other types of perfonnance assessments, and a wide range of scoring and reporting services. Information is readily available on the range of products and services in the publishers' catalogs and Web sites (see the box "Web Sites of Achievement Test Publishers").

One limitation of test batteries is that all parts of the battery are usually not equally appropriate for measuring a particular school's objectives. When a test battery is constructed, it is based on the objectives and tile content considered important by the specialists building the test. Although a particular school's goals probably will agree with some sections of tile battery, it is fairly certain that they will not agree with all sections. Variations in subject-matter content from one cUlTiculum to another and differences in grade placement of instructional materials make it unlikely tllat tile various sections of a test battery will be uniformly applicable to the instructional program of any given school. This Limitation is especially pronounced in content-oriented test batteries. **It** is less important in batteries designed to measure general educational development.

Achievement batteries are used most often at the elementalY school level. Most schools use an acheivement battery in grade 3 through 6 and may also use a battery in grade 1 and 2. Thi extensive usage in understandable beacuse there is considerable uniformity in learning outcomes sought

Elementary school batteries usually include sections on reading, language, and mathematics. To allow for increasing difficulty and for varying emphasis from one grade level to another, a series of comparable forms has been developed to cover the various grade levels. Each form in the series covers one or two grades at the primary level and two or more grades beyond grade 4. The skills in an achievement battery are measured by a number of subtests. Although the names of the subtests vary somewhat from one test publisher to another and the batteries at the primary level usually contain fewer subtests, there is considerable uniformity in the outcomes measured by the various basic skill batteries. The content areas included in an achievement test battery vary depending on the option selected (e.g., basic battery or comprehensive battery) and the publisher. For example, the multiple-choice *Stanford 10 (Stanford Achievement Test Series, Edition 10)*  Complete Battery includes Reading, Lexile Measure, Mathematics, Language,Spelling,  Listening, Science, and Social Science, whereas the *Abbreviated Battery* offers a shorter version of all subtests except Listening. Open-ended assessments can be added to supplement the multiple-choice battery in Reading, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and Language. Reading assessments now extend to early childhood with the Reading First requirements of No Child Left Behind.

Within major content areas such as reading or mathematics, publishers also offer results for various subtests. The follOWing examples of subtests are illustrative of those lIsed in each basic skill area.

 Reading
- Â· Decoding skills (discrimination, analysis)
- Â· Vocabulary (meaning of words)
- Â· Comprehension (meaning of paragraphs and other written material)

 Language
- Â· Mechanics (capitalization, punctuation)
- Â· Expression (correctness, effectiveness)
- Â· Spelling (from dictation or identifying misspelled words)

 Mathematics
- Â· Computation (fundamental operations)
- Â· Concept (meaning of concepts)
- Â· Problem solving (solving story problems)

In addition to the traditional basic skills, some achievement batteries at the elementary school level include tests in listening comprehension. For example, the Listening Assessment for the TTBS is an optional supplement to the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills that may be administered independently. Complete batteries offered by the publishers also include tests in the content areas of science and social studies. The major batteries also offer writing supplements requiring students to write essays in response to standard prompts (e.g., the Constructed-Response Supplement to the Stanford Witiing Assessment Program, and the TerraNova Performance Assessments). For these batteries, it is usually possible also to obtain a separate partial battery limited to the measurement of basic skills. Batteries confined to the basic skills are generally preferred because contentoriented tests become outdated more quickly and are seldom well suited to the objectives of the local instructional program.

Achievement batteries are less widely used at the high school level. The wide diversity of course offerings and the variations in course content within the same subject area have made it difficult to find a common core on which to base the tests. Most high school batteries focus on the same basic skills of reading, mathematics, language, and study skills that are covered by the elementary batteries (with the optional science and social studies tests). This provides for the continuous measurement of the basic skills throughout all grade levels.

Some high school batteries, such as the Iowa Tests of Educational Development, were designed to measure general educational development in intellectual skills and abilities that are not dependent on any particular series of courses. Instead, they assess analytical and evaluative skills that are needed in everyday life. The complete battery contains the following nine tests.


- Â· Vocabulary
- Â· Reading Comprehension
- Â· Language: Revising Written Materials
- Â· Spelling
- Â· Mathematics: Concepts and Problem Solving
- Â· Computation
- *Analysis of Social Studies Materials*
- *Analysis of Science Materials*
- *Sources of Information*

Interpretive-type exercises are used throughout the test battely. Sample items representing two of the tests are shown in Figure 16.1. In both tests, Part 1 focuses on understandings and thinking skills gained from the content area, and Part 2 stresses the ability to analyze and evaluate various types of material.

A list of widely used achievement batteries is shown in Table 16.2. The grade range covered by each test series is indicated in the table. In some of the test series (e.g., *Stanford),* the tests at various levels have different names, but they are all part of a coordinated series that provides for continuous assessment throughout the grade range. Also. the *Iowa Tests of Educational DevelotJment (/TED)* mav be used in coniunction with â¢ ./ .J. ... ., J I the *Iowa Tests of Basic Skills* to form a coordinated program covering grades K to 12. Although the ba tteries of tests designed to measure the basic skills are all somewhat similar in tenns of the areas of skill covered, they vary considerably in terms of the nature of the test materials used and the spedfic abilities measured within each skill area. Therefore, in selecting an achievement battelY, it is important to appraise carefully the specific test items to be certain that the abilities measured are relevant to the learning outcomes stressed in the school program. Any achievement battery will, of course, measure only some of the impOltant outcomes of the school program. Other tests and assessment procedures will be needed for comprehensive coverage of a school's objectives.

##### **Supplements to Standardized** Tests

Some test publishers provide performance assessments as supplements to their standardized tests. The most common form of supplement is a direct writing assessment. The *Stanford Writing Assessment Program,* for example, includes standard prompts that are designed to elidt written responses in four different modes of writing: (a) *Descriptive:* Students are asked to write about a place or thing based on their own experiences. (b) *Narrative:* The prompt presents a brief scenario, and students are asked to write a story. (c) *ExpoSitory:*  Students are asked to state an opinion or position regarding a topic and defend it. (d) *Persuasive:* Students are asked to write about an issue from their own point of view in a way that would persuade a particular audience. A central scoring service prOVides both holistic scores for the overall quality of the essay and analytical scores for writing mechanics, sentence formation, and usage.

##### Diagnostic Batteries for Instructional Use

Achievement test batteries traditionally were designed as survey tests. That is, they provided a general, overall measure of the various areas of the curriculum. Typically, Cours Su however, there were too few items measuring each skill to provide much help in making instructional decisions unless the content area is narrowly defined. The results might indicate that a student's performance was low in reading or mathematics, for example, but were of limited value for identifying the specific areas of strength and weakness. The few items in each area served as indicators of achievement, but they were insufficient for describing what individual students had learned, what they had yet to learn, and the types of errors they were making.

> Test publishers have taken steps to make the test results of achievement batteries more useful to classroom teachers. Some test batteries, for example, consist of an integrated series of survey tests and group-administered diagnostic tests covering the same areas of basic skills. The survey battery provides information about the students' relative performance in each of the areas, and the diagnostic tests in reading, mathematics, and language provide a more detailed description of the students' strengths and weaknesses in each skill area. This is accomplished in part by including a larger number of items in the diagnostic tests within a single content area such as reading, using more subtests, and providing for criterion-referenced interpretation. In addition to the direct interpretation of strengths and weaknesses by subscores and instructional objectives, several special features were built into the Metropolitan Achievement Tests to aid instructional decisions.

- 1. An instructional reading level can be determined by comparing the criterionreferenced reading comprehension score to graded basal readers.
- 2. An instructional mathematics level can be determined by comparing criterionreferenced mathematics scores to graded levels of mathematics books.
- 3. Various comparisons between mathematics scores can be made to determine whether low problem-solving performance is due to lack of computational skills, low reading ability, or carelessness.
- 4. A research skills score is obtained from items embedded in various subject-matter tests.
- 5. A higher-order thinking skills score is obtained from critical-thinking items used in several subject-matter tests.
- 6. Specific information is provided for instructional planning for those students needing remediation as well as for those performing at or above average levels.

Similar diagnostic batteries in reading and mathematics are provided as separate components of the Stanford Achievement Tests, the California Achievement Tests, and the TerraNova CTBS. This two-component system of survey and diagnostic tests, which are statistically linked, provides a sound approach for meeting both administrative and instructional needs. The survey tests provide a general measure of achievement for comparisons among schools, and the diagnostic tests provide a more detailed measure of achievement for assessing the learning of individual students.

##### Selecting Achievement Batteries

- 1. Achievement batteries that focus on the basic skills measure important outcomes of the elementary school program, but these constitute only a portion of the outcomes of a modem curriculum.
- 2. At the high school level, basic skill batteries may serve both as learning readiness tests and as measures of learning outcomes in remedial basic skills programs. However, they provide only a limited measure of the many intended outcomes of the secondary Sdl001 program.
- 3. Content-oriented tests in basic adlievement batteries have broad coverage but limited sampling in each content area and may tend to become more quickly outdated than basic skills tests.
- 4. Achievement batteries differ in their emphasis on the various areas of basic skills, the different areas of content, and the specific types of learning outcomes measured. Thus, the selection of a battery should be based on its relevance to the school's objectives.
- 5. Diagnostic batteries should contain a sufficient number of test items for each type of interpretation to be made.

Aithough some achievement test batteries do not have a separate series of diagnostic tests, they typically aid instmctional use by providing for analysis of results by objective, by specific skill area, or both. Whenever achievement test batteries (or any other test) provide for interpretation by objective or specific skill, it is important to note the number of test items involved. It is not uncommon to base interpretation on as few as two or three test items. A lucky guess or careless en'or may be the deciding factor in detennining whether success or failure is indicated. In such cases, it would be wiser to base instmctionaI decisions on larger item clusters formed by combining items measuring similar objectives or skills.

Group-administered survey and diagnostic batteries are useful for identifying students who could benefit from remedial teaching and individual help. More serious learning problems, however, typically require the use of individually administered diagnostic tests and a careful study of the student's total development. The diagnosis and remediation of severe learning disabilities are best left to the skilled clincian. See the Guidelines box

#### **ACHIEVEMENT TESTS IN SPECIFIC AREAS**

In addition to adlievement batteries, there are literally hundreds of separate tests designed to measure achievement in specific areas. The majority of these can be classified as tests of course content or reading tests of the general survey type. Tests also have been developed for use in determining learning readiness.

A separate test has celtain advantages over a test battelY. First, it is easier to select a test that fits the instructional objectives of a particular area. The difficulty of relating an entire battelY of tests to instructional objectives was pointed out earlier. Second, a separate test is usually longer than a battery's subtests. This provides a more adequate sample of performance and more reliable part scores for instructional and diagnostic purposes. Third , the separate test's flexibility makes it easier to adapt to classroom instruction. Teachers can administer separate tests when they best fit their instructional needs rather than following the rigid scl1edule of the school testing program.

One disadvantage of separate tests is that each one is usually standardized on a different group of students. Because norm groups are not comparable, relative achievement of students in different areas cannot be compared. For example, it is not possible to detelmine whether a student has achieved more in science than in mathematics or in social studies than in English if the tests were not standardized on the same representative group of students.

##### **Separate Content-Oriented Tests**

There are many achievement tests at the secondary level designed to measure the outcomes of specific courses. In fact, there are over 100 separate tests in each of the major content areas of English, mathematics, science, and social studies. There are also separate tests in foreign language, business, and fine arts but not as many as those designed for the basic courses. All these tests of specific course content are intended as end-of -course tests and thus are used primarily to measure the students' final levels of achievement. Although the tests vary in quality, many of them reqUire students to demonstrate understanding and application as well as knowledge of factual information. See the "Guidelines" box for selection oÂ·iteria. For a complete listing of the separate tests available for use in schools, consult the catalogs of the test publishers in Appendix E. For oÂ·itical reviews of the tests, see the latest *Mental Measu7Â·ements Yearbook.* 

Because of its flexibility and timeliness, an informal teacher-made test is frequently better suited to the measurement of instructional objectives in a particular course tl1an a standardized achievement test. However, when carefully selected according to course content and learning outcomes, the standardiZed test can serve as a valuable check on the teacher's informal classroom tests.

##### **Reading Tests**

One of the most widely used tests at all levels of instruction is the reading test. It occupies a prominent position in acheivement test batteries and receives special emphasis in tests of general educational development. In addition, there are well over 100 separate tests of reading ability.

Many reading tests are of the survey type, designed to measure a student's general level of reading ability. Such tests commonly measure vocabulary, reading comprehension, and rate of reading. The following list of reading skills is typical of those that reading survey tests attempt to measure.

- Identifies the meaning of given words
- Identifies the meaning of words when used in context

##### Selecting Sepa rate Tests **in** Specific Content Areas

- 1. Because separate tests are content oriented, the date of construction is especially impOltant. Developments in some content areas, such as science and social studies, take place at SUcll a rapid rate that some are soon out of date.
- 2. In addition to timeliness of test content, attention should be directed toward its appropriateness for the particular course in which it is to be used. Because a standardized test includes only the content common to many school systems, it may lack comprehensiveness and at the same time include questions on material that has not been covered in the local instructional program.
- 3. Many content-oriented tests emphasize the measurement of knowledge outcomes, although there are a number of exceptions. Standardized tests of specific knowledge are seldom as relevant and useful as well-constructed teacher-made tests in the same area.
- 4. When a content-oriented test measures a variety of learning outcomes beyond those of spedfic knowledge (e.g., understanding, application, interpretation), it is important that the learning outcomes measured by the test complement those emphasized in the local instructional program.

- Identifies details directly stated in a passage or selection
- Identifies ideas implied in a passage or selection
- Identifies relationships (e.g., time, cause and effect) in a passage or selection
- Identifies the main thought or pUlpose of a passage or selection
- Identifies inferences drawn from a passage or selection
- Identifies conclusions drawn from a passage or selection
- Identifies the writer's tone, mood, and intent

Reading tests differ greatly in the extent to which they cover these skills and in the degree of emphasis given to each. Some tests focus on the lower levels of comprehension (e.g., identifying directly stated details), whereas others stress the more complex interpretive skills (e.g., identifying relationships, inferences, and conclusions). Moreover, the last two reading skills in tl1is list are more likely to be found in reading tests for high school tllan elementalY school.

Reading tests also differ widely in the material to be read by the student. Some tests use short passages of a sentence or two, whereas otl1ers use extended passages. Some use stories only, and otl1ers use stories, letters, poems, and sdentific articles. Still another source of difference among reading tests is the extensiveness with which each type of reading material and each reading skill is sampled. One test, for example, may have a relatively large number of test items measuring the ability to draw conclusions from sdentific articles, whereas another test has just a few such items. These differences highlight

the importance of defining what reading abilities are to be measured before selecting a test.

Reading tests may be selected for any of the following uses: (a) to evaluate the effectiveness of reading instruction, (b) to identify those students needing remedial work in reading, (c) to predict success in subject-matter courses, (d) to determine whether poor reading ability can account for low scores on scholastic aptitude tests, and (e) to help locate the causes of learning problems. Although a single reading test may not serve all these uses equally well, how the results are to be used is an important consideration in test selection. The ideal reading test for a palticular program is the one that best measures the instructional objectives and most effectively fulftlls the uses to which the results will be put. See the "Guidelines" box for help in selecting reading tests and Appendix F for a list of reading tests.

##### **Readiness Tests**

Some tests have been designed to determine student readiness for learning school tasks. At the elementalY level, reading readiness tests are probably the most familiar, but other types of tests are also used. Although readiness tests are essentially specialized scholastic aptitude tests, they are considered here because their test items are drawn from specific achievement areas. This gives them the advantage of proViding diagnostic as well as predictive infornlation. Thus, in addition to predicting learning success in a particular achievement area, test performance can provide information concerning the specific skills that students need to improve if their learning is to be effective.

**GUIDELINES Selecting Reading Tests**

- **1.** No two reading tests are exactly alike. Although reading survey tests usually measure vocabulary, reading comprehension, and rate of reading, they differ in me material that the reader is expected to comprehend, in the specific reading skills tested, and in the adequacy with whidl each skill is measured.
- 2. Reading slllvey tests measure only some of the outcomes of reading instruction. The medlanics of reading (e.g., perceptual skills and word analysis) are typical1y measured by diagnostic reading tests. Some specialized reading skills (e.g., reading maps, graphs, and charts) are more commonly measured by tests of study skil1s. Attitude toward reading and interest in reading, bam of whidl are extremely impoI1ant outcomes of reading instruction, must be determined by obselvation or other means.

3. Reading tests can serve many purposes in the school program. Thus, in addition to matching the objectives of instruction, test selection should take into account all the possible uses to be made of the results.

In the 1980s, many school districts started making wider use of early school readiness tests, not for the instmctional planning purposes that the tests are intended to serve but for screening children before they are allowed to start kindergarten or first grade. That is, children with low scores are often forced to delay stalting kindergarten for a year, are retained a second year in kindergarten, or are placed for a year in a transitional class before starting the first grade. Unfortunately, none of the available readiness tests has sufficiently high predictive validity to SUpPOlt this type of use. They are more appropriate ly used to make instmctional decisions regarding skills a child needs to develop.

Early School Readiness and Achievement Tests. Several tests have been developed to measure those basic concepts and skills considered essential for effective learning in the early school years. The tests are intended. to be useful in instmctional planning. The tests are usually designed for preschool use (kindergalten or sooner) but also can be used in the early primaly grades. A typical example is the *Boehm Test of Basic Concepts-Revised.*  This test is based on a selection of verbal concepts (e.g., *biggest, nearest, several)* that are needed to understand oral conununication and to profit most from school experiences. The test items are read to the students, and tlley answer by placing an X on the pictures designed to measure tlle concepts.

Reading Readiness Tests. Tests of reading readiness are L1 sed at the kindergalten and first-grade level to help identify skills that have been mastered and those that need to be learned and to help plan beginning reading instmction. The following functions are commonly measured by reading readiness tests.

- 1. Visual discrimination: Identifying similarities and differences in words, leeters, numbers, geometric figures, or pictures
- 2. Auditory discrimination: Identifying similarities and differences in spoken words or sounds
- 3. Verbal comprehension: Demonstrating or understanding the meaning of words, sentences, and directions
- 4. Recognition of letters, words, and numbers: Identifying letters of the alphabet, words, and numerals
- 5. Recognition of words in sample lessons: Identifying words that have been taught in sample lessons
- 6. Memory: Reproducing a geometric figure, following instmctions, or selecting a picture from memolY
- 7. Drawing or copying: Demonstrating skill in drawing or copying geometriC forms,

Not all reading readiness tests provide comprehensive coverage of tllese areas. Some tests cover only a few readiness skills, whereas others include tasks from four or five of the areas. Thus, as in all types of testing, the first step is to decide what is to be measured. In this particular case, it means deciding what reading readiness skills are most relevant to tlle reading program. A clear description of the skills to be measured is a prerequisite to valid test selection and use. See the "Guidelines" box for selecting readiness tests.

A typical example of a widely used readiness test is tlle *Metropolitan Readiness Test.*  It is available in two levels: Levell is used up to the middle of kindergarten, and Level 2

**GUIDELINES Selecting Readiness Tests**

- **1.** Because these tests are predictive instruments, the test manual should be examined concerning the effectiveness with which they predict success in the given area. Validity coefficients should be at least as high as those obtained with general scholastic aptitude tests and preferably higher.
- 2. In addition to their predictive value, these tests also have some general diagnostic value. Thus, the test's content should be evaluated in light of the type of readiness information desired and the uses to be made of the results.
- 3. These tests provide just a fraction of the information needed to determine readiness for learning in a given area. The pupil's social and emotional adjustment, past achievement in the area, motivation to learn, and cultural background also must be taken into account.
- 4. Readiness tests do not have sufficient predictive validity to be used alone to sO'een children out of Kindergarten or delay entry into first grade.

is used in the second half of kindergarten and the first half of the first grafe. The Metropolitan*Readiness Test: VelSion* 6 measures readiness in the following three areas:

- 1. Emerging literacy concepts in an authentic context
- 2. Developing language/ literacy concepts
- 3. Developing quantitative/ mathematics concepts

Readiness for beginning reading involves more than the skills measured by readiness tests. Sud1 factors as mental ability, physical development, experiential background, social and emotional adjustment, and desire to read also must be considered. The readiness test focuses on important prerequisite skills, but test performance must be interpreted in light of the student's total readiness for learning.

#### **CUSTOMIZED ACHIEVEMENT TESTS**

Banks of objectives and related test items are maintained by most large test publishers and by some other organizations. These item banks are used for computer generation of customized tests. In some cases, the tests are prepared by the test publisher. In others, the publisher will sell or lease computer software that indudes banks of items keyed to objectives and a program for constructing and printing locally prepared customized tests.

When using publisher-prepared customized achievement tests, the test user typically selects the objectives to be measured from an objective catalog and specifies the number of items to be used for measuring each objective. The test publisher then assembles and prints the test by taking from the item banks those items that measure the selected objectives. Scoring and reporting services are also available from the publisher for these tests.

Customized tests prepared by test publishers or prepared locally are especially useful for classroom testing because they can be designed to yield measurements of the specific knowledge and skills covered in the instructional program. Locally controlled microcomputer systems have the added advantage of being able to prepare tests as needed, without the time lag created when ordering customized tests from the publisher. In addition, a computer system makes it easy to add locally prepared objectives and test items to the bank. In using customized tests, however they are prepared, it is important to select the objectives carefully and to include enough items for each instructional objective or skill cluster to provide for reliable interpretations. It is also necessary, of course, to make certain that the individual items are relevant to the instructional objectives they are to measure.

Information concerning customized test development and microcomputer software can be obtained from test publishers' catalogs. See Appendix E for test publishers' addresses and a list of banks of items keyed to objectives that are available for school use.

#### INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT TESTS

Because of the increased number of students with disabilities in the regular classroom, it would seem desirable for classroom teachers to become familiar with some of the individual tests that are available for measuring achievement. These tests are administered to one student at a time and the questions are typically answered orally or by pointing, although some writing may be required. Some of the tests provide for norm-referenced interpretation, some use criterion-referenced interpretation, and still others provide for both types of interpretation. Typical examples of individual achievement tests include the following:

- Â· Basic Achievement Skills Individual Screener (grade 1 to adult)
- Â· Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised (K to adult)
- Â· KeyMath Diagnostic Arithmetic Test-Revised (K to grade 6)
- Â· Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised (K to adult)

Each of these tests can be administered in 30 to 60 minutes, with much of the scoring completed during the administration. Other individual achievement tests can be obtained from test publishers' catalogs (see Appendix E). For reviews of these and other achievement tests discussed in this chapter, see the latest Mental Measurements Yearbook, as described in Chapter 18.

#### SUMMARY

Standardized achievement tests measure the common objectives of a wide variety of schools, have standard procedures for administration and scoring, and provide norms for interpreting the scores. A test manual and other accessory materials are typically provided to aid in the administration of the test and the intelpretation and use of the results. The test items are generally of high quality because they have been prepared by specialists, pretested, and selected on the basis of their effectiveness and their relevance to a rigid set of specifications.

Despite their high tedmical quality, standardized adlievement tests complement rather than replace teachers' infonnal dassroom tests. They are especially useful for measuring general educational development, determining student progress from one year to the next, grouping students, diagnosing learning difficulties, and comparing achievement with learning ability. They are of less va lue for measuring learning outcomes unique to a particular course, the day-to-day progress of students, and knowledge of CUlTent developments in rapidly changing fields. These purposes are more effectively served by infonnal classroom tests.

Achievement test batteries are widely used at the elementary Sdlool level. They cover the basic skills (Le. , reading, language, mathematics, and study skills), and some batteries also include sections on listening comprehension, science, and social studies. Test batteries are less widely used at the high sdmol level because of the difficulty of identifying a corrunon core of content. Batteries at this level are confined to the basic skills, to content included in the basic high school subjects, or to measures of general educational development. The main advantage of a test battelY is that a student's strengths and weaknesses in different areas can be determined. Most test batteries provide for both norm-referenced interpretation and interpretation by objective or skill area. The complete test battery seldom fits all the instructional objectives of the Sdlool, however, and this must be taken into account when one is interpreting the results.

standardized tests. Writing supplements are the most common addition, but sets of open-ended assessment tasks are also offered in different content areas. Typically, the responses can be scored locally or by means of a central scoring service. When the central scoring option is used, the scores can be compared to national norms.

The instructional use of achievement batteries has been enhanced by the publishing of sets of diagnostic batteries that are statistically linked to the survey batteries. The larger number of items and subtests in the diagnostic batteries makes it possible to obtain a more detailed description of eadl student's strengths and weaknesses in learning.

**In** addition to adlievement test batteries, there are many separate published tests designed to measure achievement in specific areas. These include tests on course content, reading tests, and readiness tests. Although these can be more readily adapted to the instructional program than complete batteries, the following cautions should be kept in mind during their selection and use: (a) Published tests with similar titles may differ radically in tem1S of the type of test content and in terms of tile emphasis given to the variolls skills measured; (b) published tests measure only a portion of the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to evaluate, predict, or diagnose learning progress; and (c) published tests are effective to tile extent that they measure tile instructional objectives and serve the intended uses of tile particulaJ school program in which they are administered.

To more adequately meet the needs of classroom teachers for individualized instruction and mastery learning, test publishers are now making available customized achievement tests. Some publishers also provide item banks and softwaJe progral11S that enable Sdlools to produce their own customized tests with microcomputers. These customized achievement tests measure student mastery of locally selected instructional objectives and thus describe what learning tasks a student can and cannot perform in the local instructional program. The interpretations must be made with great caution, however, because there are frequently a small number of test items measuring each objective or skill.

There are now many students with handicaps in regular classrooms. In testing these students, an individual achievement test may be more appropriate. These are administered on a one-to-one basis, and the questions are typically answered orally or by pointing. There are a number of such tests available for school use.

### CHAPTER 17: APTITUDE TESTS

I ptitude tests are designed to predict future performance in some activity. Those used in schools range from traditional scholastic aptitude tests to more comprehensive differential aptitude tests. Attempts have also been made to develop special culture-fair tests. In this chapter, typical examples of aptitude tests used in schools are discussed and illustrated.

Aptitude tests can provide information that is useful in determining learning readiness, individualizing instruction, organizing classroom groups, identifying underachievers, diagnosing learning problems, and helping students with their educational and vocational plans. Although the results of achievement tests are also useful for these purposes, aptitude tests make a special contribution.

To avoid misinterpretations and misuses it is important to understand the limitations as well as the strengths of aptitude tests. Contrary to popular belief, aptitude tests do not measure a fixed capacity. Rather, they provide an indication of present level of learned abilities and can be useful in predicting future performance. Performance on aptitude tests is influenced by previous learning experiences, but it is less directly dependent on specific courses of instruction than is performance on achievement tests.

#### ACHIEVEMENT AND APTITUDE TESTS

Before we discuss the various types of aptitude tests, we consider some similarities and differences between achievement tests and aptitude tests. A common distinction is that achievement tests measure what a student has learned and that aptitude tests measure the ability to learn new tasks. Although this appears to be a clear distinction, it oversimplifies the problem and hides important similarities and differences. Actually, both measure what a student has learned, and both are useful for predicting success in learning new tasks. The main differences lie in (a) the types of learning measured by each test and (b) the types of prediction for which each test is most useful.

##### Types of Learning Measured: The Ability Spectrum

The various types of lea rning measured by achievement and aptitude tests can be best depicted if they are arranged along a continuum, as shown in Table 17.1. In this spectrum of ability tests, achievement tests fall at Levels A and B, and aptitude tests fa ll at Levels C, D, and E. The spectrum classifies the various types of tests according to the degree to whicll the test content depends on specific learning experiences. At o ne extreme (Level A) is the content-oriented achievement test that measures knowledge of specific course content. At the other extreme (Level E) is the culture-oriented nonverbal aptitude test that measures a type of learning not influenced much by typical scll ool experiences. Thus, as we move through the different levels of the spectmm from A to E, the test content becomes less dependent on any particular set of learning experiences.

The closer in the spectnlln, the more nearly alike will be the types of learning measured. Achievement tests designed to measure general educational development (Level B) and scholastic aptitude tests based on school-learned abilities (Level C), for example, both measure somewhat similar abilities and can be expected to correlate highly. Likewise, the farther apart two tests are in the spectrum, the less they will have in conunon and the lower the correlation will be between them. This information is useful in selecting and using aptitude tests. For instance, we can expect aptitude tests at Levels C and D to provide a better prediction of school achievement than those at Level E. On the other hand, if we are primarily interested in identifying students with undeveloped learning potential, tests at Level E will be more useful. When using this spectmm, however, remember that these are merely convenient categories for classifying the different types of ability tests and that some tests will cover two or more categories. Several Wide-spectrum

scholastic aptitude tests, for example, include a range of test content covering Levels C, D, and E in a single test score.

##### Types of Predictions Made with Achievement and Aptitude Tests

Achievement and aptitude tests also can be distinguished according to the types of predictions for which each is most useful. Because past achievement is frequently the best predictor of future achievement, both types of achievement tests (Levels A and B) are useful in predicting future learning. In general, the content-oriented achievement test (Level A) can predict how well a student will learn new knowledge in the same content area, but it is of less value in predicting future learning in other areas. For example, a test of first-semester English will be a good predictor of second-semester English but not of second-semester mathematics, science, or social studies. In other words, its value as a predictor of future learning depends largely on the relationship between the content being measured and the content in the future learning situation. Tests measuring general educational development (Level B) are much more effective predictors of future achievement than are content-oriented tests because they measure intellectual skills and abilities common to a variety of content areas.

If achievement tests are such good predictors of future learning, then why do we use aptitude tests (Levels C to E) in schools? There are several good reasons. First, an aptitude test can be administered in a relatively short time (some as short as 20 minutes), whereas a comprehensive battery of achievement tests takes several hours. Second, aptitude tests can be used with students of more widely varying educational backgrounds. Because the type of learning measured is common to most students, an individual is less apt to be penalized because of specific weaknesses in past instruction. Third, aptitude tests can be used before a student has had any training in a particular area. For example, success in a French course cannot be predicted by an achievement test in French until the person has had some instruction in it. Another reason applies more to the culture-oriented aptitude test (Levels D and E). Because these measures of aptitude are least influenced by school-learned abilities, they can be used to distinguish low achievers working up to their ability from those with the potential for higher achievement. Identifying such underachievers with aptitude tests that depend heavily on school-learned abilities (Level C) is possible but less effective because the achievement skills required to respond to the test are those in which the underachiever is most apt to be weak.

In summary, both achievement tests and aptitude tests measure learned abilities, but achievement tests measure that are more directly dependent on specific school experiences, whereas aptitude tests measure those based on a wide range of both in-school and out-of-school experiences. This is a matter of degree, however, and it is possible to arrange both types of tests on a continuum, ranging from the measurement of specific course content (Level A) to the measurement of more broadly based abilities (Levels D and E). Achievement tests and aptitude tests become very much alike near the center of the continuum (Levels B and C). Achievement and aptitude tests are also similar in that both are useful for predicting future achievement. In general, aptitude tests are a more convenient measure and one that predicts over a wide range of future experiences. As with types of learning outcomes measured, these differences are less pronounced near the center of the continuum.

#### **SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE AND LEARNING ABILITY**

Tests designed to measure learning ability traclitionally have been called "intelligence tests. " This tenninology is still used for some individually administered tests and for some group tests, but its lise is declining. There are a number of reasons for this: (a) Many people have come to associate the concept **i1ltelltge'flce** with inherited capacity; (b) there is increasing controversy over the meaning of intelligence and the factors that should be induded in the concept; and (c) tests in this area have been increasingly used for predicting achievement and describing learning abilities. **In** place of the term *intelligence tests* have come such tenus as *learning ability tests, school ability tests, cognitive ability tests,* and *scholastic aptitude tests.* All these terms emphasize the fact that these tests measure developed abilities useful in learning and not innate capacity or undeveloped potential.

Students' scores on scholastic aptitude tests or ability tests are best interpreted as a measure of present learning ability. Test performance is influenced by such factors as inherited characteristics, experiential background, motivation, palticular skills (e.g., reading and test taking), attention, persistence, self-confidence, and emotional adjustment. All these factors are part of an individual's present ability to pelfol1l1 and, as SUdl, affect both test scores and school achievement. 1any of these factors can be modified. by educational experiences, however, and therefore both learning ability and school achievement can be improved. It is when we misinterpret the test scores as unmodifiable measures of learning potential that we are apt to misuse the results.

#### **GROUPTESTS OF LEARNING ABILITY**

The majority of tests of learning ability administered in the schools are group tests. These are tests that, like standardized adlievement tests, can be administered to many students at one time by persons with relatively little training in test administration. Some group tests yield a single score; others yield two or more scores based on measures of separate aspects of ability. Here we briefly describe and illustrate the various types of group tests. Critical reviews of these and other ability tests can be found in the *Mental Measurements Yearbooks.* 

##### **Single-Score Tests**

Tests that yield a single score are sometimes designed to measure students' general learning ability. Typically, such a variety of types of items is induded in the test that no particular ability or skill receives undue emphasis in the total score. Thus, the specific aspects of ability (SUdl as verbal, numerical, and abstract reasoning) are blended together into one global measure of ability. These are sometimes called wide-spectrum tests and cover Levels C through E in the spectrum of abilities described earlier (see Table 17.1).

The Single-score test based on a mixture of general verbal and nonverbal items is less common than it once was. Even one of the most widely used tests of this type, the *Om-Lennon School Ability Test (OLSATT,"),* has moved a way from a single score. The fifth

and earlier editions of the OLSAT reported a single general score. The sixth edition, published in 1989, the seventh edition, published in 1996, and the eighth edition, published in 2006, report separate verbal and nonverbal scores as well as a total score.

It is now more common for single-score tests to focus on verbal abilities. Like the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts, 3rd Edition, that was discussed in Chapter 16, single ability tests are typically used to measure readiness for school learning and to predict success in future schoolwork. They are highly verbal in nature, and this, of course, contributes to their predictive value because school learning is largely verbal. There are exceptions, however, to this general emphasis on verbal abilities. The Matrix Analogies Test-Short Form, for example, is a test of nonverbal reasoning that presents abstract designs with missing elements or matrices containing a progression of elements. Students are asked to select the missing element or the next element in the progression.

Whether a test contains a mixture of verbal and nonverbal items or focuses on only one of these abilities, single-score tests do not provide for differential prediction for various types of schoolwork. They are intended only as a general measure of current learning readiness. Thus, a low score will indicate a lack of readiness to perform well on school tasks but will reveal neither the nature nor the cause of the poor performance. Single-score ability tests provide a quick, effective, general measure of present learning ability.

##### Tests Yielding Separate Scores

A number of tests of learning ability yield two or more part scores as well as the total score. Some tests, like the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test, Eighth Edition (Grades K-12) (OLSATâ¢8), have both verbal and nonverbal scores as well as a total score. The nonverbal score provides a check on the verbal score for those students who have limited verbal skills (e.g., poor readers). Other tests provide verbal and quantitative scores. The purpose of these is to obtain differential prediction of school success between courses emphasizing verbal concepts and those emphasizing mathematical concepts. Predictive studies indicate that verbal scores tend to be the best predictor of success in most courses, however, so interpretations concerning differential prediction must be cautiously made. A relatively large difference between verbal and quantitative scores is needed before it is meaningful. The test manual will indicate what size score difference is significant.

When administered with an associated achievement test battery, ability tests such as the OLSAT can be used to obtain "achievement/ability comparisons." For example, the OLSATâ¢8 was normed with the Stanford 10 achievement tests. If both the OLSATâ¢8 and the Stanford 10 are administered, achievement/ability comparison scores can be obtained that describe a student's achievement in relation to the achievement of other students with the same ability as measured by the OLSAT.

The Cognitive Abilities Test (CogATÂ®) (Grades K-12) provides a measure of three types of reasoning ability important in school learning. It provides scores for each of three different test batteries: verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal. The test includes three primary levels for testing in kindergarten through grade 2 and eight higher levels for use in grades 3 through 12. These later eight levels are published in a single multilevel booklet that contains all three batteries. With the multilevel format, the items in each subtest are arranged

in order of increasing difficulty, and the examinees start and stop at different places, depending on their grade level. If the assigned level is inappropriate for a particular group (e.g., extremely good or poor readers), it is simply a matter of shifting to a higher or lower level within the test.

The primary levels of the *Cognitive Abilities Test, Form* 6 include the following six tests.

**Verbal Battery**

*Oral Vocabulary.* Mark a picture that illustrates a word or phrase read aloud (e.g., "the one that is round").

*Verbal Reasoning.* Mark a picture that belongs with three other pictures that are alike in some way (e.g., all are toys).

**Quantitative Battery**

*Quantitative Concepts.* "ark a picture illustrating a concept (e.g., half a pie). *Relational Concepts.* Mark a picture illustrating a relation (e.g. , tallest tree).

**Nonverbal Battery**

*Matrices.* Mark the figure that completes a four-<:ell matrix containing tl1Jee geometric figures and one empty cell.

*Figure Classification.* Mark the figure that belongs with three other figures that are alike in some way (e.g., all are triangles).

Tests at the primary level are all administered with oral directions, and a predetermined pattern of testing is followed . The order alternates tests from different batteries to maintain interest and attention. Time limits are suggested, but they are power tests, not speed tests. The test administrator reads the instructions for each item and allows sufficient time for all children to try the item. No reading is involved.

The multilevel edition for grades 3 to 12 contains three tests in each of the tl1Jee batteries: verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal. The tlu'ee tests in the verbal battery are illustrated by the sample items shown in Figure 17.1. The items in all three tests include verbal tasks that have not been directly taught in school but require the use of verbal concepts that have been learned both in and out of scl1001. The instructions for our illustrative items are velyabbreviated.

The quantitative battery contains three tests that require students to solve quantitative tasks that have not been directly taught in school. The sample items in Figure 17.2 illustrate the nature of these tests. like the verbal battelY, the emphasis is on reasoning abilities that reqUire the use of concepts that have been learned both in and out of school.

The nonverbal battery consists of three tests using geometric shapes and figures, as illustrated in Figure 17.3. The concepts needed to solve the problems in these items are learned plimarily from experiences out of school. Because the tests use neither words nor numbers, the nonverbal battery provides a poorer prediction of school success than the other two batteries. However, the nonverbal tests provide a more accurate measure of the reasoning abilities of poor readers and those deficient in language skills.

**In** keeping with the current trend in ability testing, the authors make explicit that this test measures developed abilities that are modifiable by experience.

All users of the *Cognitive Abilities Test* should recognize that it measures developed abilities, not innate abilities. The cognitive skills measured by the test reflect the cognitive strategies and general cognitive control processes that an individual has developed, from experience both in and out of Scl1001, that enable him or her to learn new tasks or solve problems when instruction is absent or incomplete. Research has clearly shown that these skills change as individuals get older and as their experiences both in and out of school become broader and more varied (Thorndike and Hagen, 1993).

The use of standard age scores, in place of the outmoded deviation IQ used in some older tests, helps avoid the many misinterpretations associated with IQ scores.

The *Cognitive Abilities Test* was described and illustrated in considerable detail because it shows the vaIiety of item types used in group ability tests and includes some of the current trends in testing (e.g., use of a multilevel fonnat, elimination of the terms *intelligence* and *IQ scores,* and emphasis on power rather than speed of work). There are, of course, many other good tests of learning ability. See Appendix F for representative examples.

##### **Choosing the Appropriate Test**

The decision as to whicl1 type of test to select depends largely on the use to be made of the results. If the test is to be used only for an overall prediction of Scl1001 success, a single-score test would suffice. However, if we want to obtain a more accurate measure of the reasoning abilities of poor readers or want to detect students weak in quantitative reasoning, then a test yielding separate scores would be favored. The single-score test provides a quick, easy-to-administer, global measure of reasoning ability, but multiscore tests provide information concerning several separate types of reasoning ability.

If the ability testis to be used in conjunction with an achievement test battery, then it is important that both the ability test and the achievement battery be standardized on the same population. This makes it possible to compare directly the two sets of scores and thus obtain a more complete descIiption of educational progress and the factors affecting it. Most publishers of achievement test batteIies publish a corresponding ability test, covering the same grade levels, and administer both to the same sta.ndardization groups. A list of such ability and achievement tests is presented in Table 17.2. In some cases, it may be desirable to select the achievement battery first and then use the ability test that has been standardized on the same groups.

#### **INDIVIDUAL TESTS**

Learning abilities are also measured by individual tests. These are typically called intelligence tests or intelligence scales, but a broader interpretation is more defensible. Like the group tests, they measure present abilities that have been acquired through both in-school and out-of-school experiences.

Individual tests are administered to one examinee at a time in a face-to-face situation. The problems are presented orally by the examiner, and the examinee responds by pointing, giving an oral answer, or performing some manipulative task. The administration of individual tests requires extensive training. This is typically obtained in a special course in individual testing. A basic part of the course is extensive practice in test administration under supervision. No one should attempt to use individual tests without this special training.

Group tests provide a satisfactory estimate of learning abilities for the majority of students. However, individual tests have some special advantages over a group test. Because the individual test is administered to one student at a time, it is possible to control more carefully such factors as motivation and to assess more accurately the extent to which disabling behaviors are influencing the score. The influence of reading skill is deemphasized because the tasks are presented orally to the student. In addition, clinical insights concerning the student's method of attacking problems and persistence in solving them are more readily obtained with individual testing. These advantages make the individual test especially useful for testing young children, for retesting students whose scores on group tests are questionable, and for testing students with special problems. For example, in planning individualized programs for students with mental handicaps, the more dependable and informative individual measure of ability is preferred.

The two most highly regarded individual tests for use with school children are the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Each of these is briefly described. Although teachers would not be expected to administer such tests, some familiarity with the testing procedures should contribute to more effective interpretation and use of the test scores.

##### Stanford-Binet Scale, Fifth Edition

The fifth edition of the Stanford-Binet Scale changed considerably from earlier editions. In the former editions (from 1908 on), the tests were arranged by age levels, and the examiner presented a variety of item types as he or she moved from one age level to the next. The resulting measure of ability was expressed as a mental age that was then converted to a deviation IQ with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 16. The deviation IQ represented a highly verbal measure of general ability.

In the fifth edition, the organization of the tests includes five factors by two domains. That is, each of the factors includes a nonverbal and a verbal domain. The five factors being measured are Fluid Reasoning, Knowledge, Quantitative Reasoning, Visual-Spatial Processing, and Working Memory. The 10 subtests include many of the item types of earlier editions but provide broader coverage of the nonverbal domain, which is more valuable for evaluating learner disabilities and individuals with limited English.

The *Stanford-Binet* includes standard scores, percentile ranks, grade equivalents, and change-sensitive scores. Intelligence Scores (Full Scale, Abbreviated, Nonverbal, and Verbal) have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Scores on the same scale can also be obtained. for each of the five factor scores (Fluid Reasoning, Knowledge, Quantitative Reasoning, Visual-Spatial Processing, and Working Memory). The 10 subtest scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3.

The *Stanford-Binet also* repolts validity studies that show its usefulness for identifying disabilities. Spedfic studies have been completed for identifying individuals who are learning disabled, gifted , mentally retarded, ADHD, speech and language delayed, traumatic brain injured, or autistic.

##### **Wechsler Scales**

The *Wechsler Scales* include t1uÂ·ee tests that collectively cover all ages, from age 3 through adult:

- *1. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intetligenceâ¢- 1bird Edition (2002) (WPPSI-IIIÂ®)* (ages 2.5-7.25)
- *2. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for ChildrenÂ®-Fourth Edition* (2003) (wrsc-~ (ages 6-16)
- *3. Wechsler Adult Intelligen.ce Scale Â®- 1bird Edition* (1997) *(WAfS-IIIÂ®-;* (ages 16-adult)

The *Wechsler* tests repon a full-scale IQ and from two to six factor or index scores that are the sum of multiple subtests. Although the factors and subtests valY slightly from one level to another, the following factors and subtests from the *WISC-IV* exemplify the test content in the *Wechsler Scales.* The sample questions in parentheses were not taken from the *WISC-IVbut* are similar to items in the *WISC-IV.* 

 **Verbal Comprehension**

- 1 . Similarities: Explain in what way a series of paired things are alike (e.g., apple and orange).
- 2. Vocabulary: Tell the meaning of words from a master list of 32, arranged in order of ina-easing difficulty.
- 3. Comprehension: Answer questions requiring conunonsense comprehension (e.g., "Why should people tell the trutl1?").

*Infonnation (supplementary):* Answer questions based on general information (e.g. , "How many legs does a cat have?"). May be included in the Verbal Comprehension scale.

*Word Reasoning (supplementaty):* Identifies an underlying concept given successive clues. May be included in the Verbal Comprehension scale.

 **Perceptual Reasoning**

- 4. Block Design: Arrange sets of blocks (colored red and white) so that they match pictures of designs on examiner's cards.
- 5. Picture Concepts: From two or three rows of concepts, the pair that go together are selected (e.g., pictures include two animals, a pencil, and a toy).
- 6. Matrix Reasoning: Fill in a grid with the graphic that completes the matrix. *Picture Completion (supplementary):* Tell what part is missing in incomplete pictures. May be included in Perceptual Reasoning scale.

 **Working Memory**

- 7. Digit Span: Repeat a series of digits forward and backward after hearing them once (e.g., 493).
- 8. Letter-Number Sequencing: Presented with a mixed sequence of letters and numbers, the child repeats the numbers first in numerical order followed by the letters in alphabetical order (e.g., F83A).

*Arithmetic (supplementary):* Solve problems similar to those used in school (e.g., "If two pencils cost a nickel, how many could you buy for a qu alter? "). May be inciuded in the working Memory scaie.

 **Processing Speed**

- 9. Coding: Match numbers and symbols by referring to a simple code that is kept in front of the examinee.
- 10. Symbol Search: Locate a designated symbol.

*Cancellation (supplementary):* Remove a nonanimal object from a series of random and stmctured animal target forms. May be included in the Processing Speed scale.

Each subtest in the *W1SC-JV* is administered and scored separately. The tests are administered by alternating between the verbal and performance scales to maintain greater interest and attention. The raw scores on the individual tests are converted to scaled scores with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. They are then combined to produce a factor score and a total IQ. The factor scores and the total IQ are deviation IQs with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.

The three *Wechsler Scales* are similar in test content and organization, and all three proVide the same deviation IQs for the factor scores and the total scales. Like the *Stanford-Binet,* a number of abbreviated scales also can be used for various screening purposes.

Botb the *Stanford-Binet* and the *Wechsler Scales* have been widely used for the individual testing of school children. Both yield highly reliable results (.90+ for the full-scale scores) when administered by competent examiners, and they are probably equally good for predicting success in ScllOO!.

#### **CAUTIONS IN INTERPRETING AND USING LEARN ING ABILITY SCORES**

Keep in mind the following cautions when interpreting and using learning ability tests.

1. Allow for nomla.l variation in the test scores. Learning ability or scholastic aptitude tests are some of our most reliable psychological tests. A reliability coefficient of .90 (which is typical), however, results in a standard error of measurement of approximately 5 points (SO = 15). Thus, a score of 100 should be interpreted as a band of scores ranging from 95 to 105 rather than as a precise point. When scores from different tests are compared, we can expect differences larger than 5 points because the tests measure different aspects of ability, and are standardized on different populations. The largest variations in scores can be found at the elementary school levels because abilities are less stable during their formation and testing conditions are more difficult to control with elementary students.

2. Seek the causes of low scores. The scores on learning ability tests are based on the use of concepts acquired from both in-school and our-of-school experiences. Thus, inadequate motivation to do school tasks, a language handicap, or a barren home environment can prevent the learning of concepts required in the test. Similarly, poor reading ability, lack of test-taking skills, anxiety, and low self-esteem can lower scores by adversely influencing test performance. Many of these factors can be detected by simply looking for possible causes of low scores. Following up low scores on a group test with an individual test is also helpful. This reduces the influence of reading ability and provides for more careful observation of test-taking skills, language skills, motivation, and other relevant personal characteristics.

3. Velify test results by comparison with other information. More effective interpretation of learning ability test scores is likely to result when test performance is checked against teachers' obselvations, achievement test scores, and other evidence of learning and development. Discrepancies between the test scores and other information may suggest retesting or clarify the nature of the factors influencing test performance.

4. Use the test results to improve learning. Learning ability tests provide a fairly good prediction of school success. Correlations between these test scores and school marks typically fall between .40 and .60. When correlated with scores on achievement test batteries, correlations of .60 to .80 are common. Unfortunately, the relationship between learning ability test scores and achievement is all too frequently used as a rationalization for inadequate school performance. for example we might hear comments such as "These students aren't doing well in school because of their poor learning ability." Instead, teachers should alter the instruction for these children, slow the pace, introduce programs that build up their verba.! and quantitative concepts, and provide more direction and practice in problem solving. The same factors that lower school achievement (e.g., poor verbal and quantitative development) also lower scores on learning ability tests, and both types of performance are modifiable. Thus, learning ability scores can be used, in conjunction witl1 other information, to fadlitate plans for improved learning ratl1er than as an excuse for lack of school success.

5. Be cautious in identifying students as underachievers. Comparing a student's scores on a learning ability test and an achievement test and labeling the student as an underachiever if the achievement test scores are lower is fraught with difficulties. Because both are measuring developed abilities, these discrepancies typically can be accounted for by such factors as the measurement error in both tests, the differences in content measured by the two tests, and variations in attitude and attention during test taking. If the two tests are normed on different populations, another basis for deviation is introduced. Discrepancies between learning ability and achievement test scores simply reflect the fact that the correlation between them is far from perfect. The safest procedure is to consider only very large discrepancies as possible signs of underachievement and then confirm these judgments by examining other types of information.

#### CULTURE-FAIR TESTING

Because all tests are measures of learned abilities, special problems arise when testing the aptitudes of individuals from different cultures and subcultures. Numerous cultural differences are likely to influence test performance. In addition to the more obvious one of language, there are such differences as motivation, attitude toward testing, competitiveness, speed, practice in test taking, and opportunity to learn the knowledges and skills measured by the test. Culture-fair testing is an attempt to obtain a measure of ability that is relatively free of all or most of these differences. Although various approaches have been used to accomplish this, the following procedures are typical: (a) The test materials are primarily nonverbal and include diagrams or pictures familiar to the various cultural groups for whom the test is intended. Sometimes translated verbal tests are used. (b) Attempts are made to use materials and methods that are interesting to the examinees in order to encourage motivation. (c) Liberal time limits are typically provided to deemphasize speed as a factor. (d) The test procedures are kept simple in order to rule out differences in test-taking experience. (e) Test content is based on those intellectual skills common to the cultural groups being tested. Of course, culture-fair testing is an ideal, not a reality. Most attempts to remove cultural influences from tests have fallen short of their goal. CourseSman

One of the best-known tests in this area is R. B. Cattell's Culture-Fair Intelligence Tests. These short, nonverbal tests use pictures and diagrams common to many cultures. There are three scales available for different age levels. Scale 1 is for ages 4 to 8. It includes eight subtests, four of which must be administered individually. Scales 2 and 3 (age 8-adult) each contain four subtests, involving the following perceptual tasks (see sample items in Figure 17.4).

- 1. Series: Select the item that comes next in a series.
- 2. Classification: Select the item that does not belong with the others.
- 3. Matrices: Select the item that completes a matrix.
- 4. Conditions: Match the conditions in a sample design by placing a dot in the appropriate place on one of several alternate designs. In the item in Figure 17.4, the dot must be in the circle but not in the small square.

Scales 2 and 3 can be administered individually or as group tests. They have been given to individuals in a number of countries with mixed results. In general, test petfonnance tended to differ most where the cultural differences were greatest. When used in schools in the United States, the *Culture-Fair Intelligence Tests* can be expected to produce results similar to those of the *Nonverbal Battery of the Cognitive Abilities Test.* 

#### **DIFFERENTIAL APTITUDE TESTING**

The work of Guilford (1967) had an important influence in moving testing from the measurement of a limited number of general mental abilities to the measurement of numerous specific abilities. On the basis of years of research, using the method of factor analysis, he proposed a three-dimensional model to provide a complete "structure of intellect." His theoretical model is shown in Figure 17.5. The model contains 120 cells

![](_page_441_Figure_1.jpeg)

 Figure 17.5

Guilford's structure of intellect model

![](_page_441_Figure_4.jpeg)

(5 x 6 x 4), and each cell represents an ability that can be described by (a) what the person does (operation), (b) the nature of the material on which the operation is performed (content), and (c) the type of outcome or product involved (product). For example, a test based on figure analogies, like that in the nonverbal battery of Cognitive Abilities Test (see Figure 17.3), would be classified in the Cognition-Figural-Relations cell because it calls for the recognition of figure relations. Similarly, a test using verbal analogies, such as those in the verbal battery of Cognitive Abilities Test (see Figure 17. 1), would be classified in the Cognition-Semantic-Relations cell because it calls for the recognition of the relations between word meanings.

Tests have not been developed for each of the cells in the structure of intellect, but the model has served as a guide to Guilford and his coworkers in their search for specific abilities. Although it was assumed that someday there will be tests for all 120 cells, many of the distinctions between cells are so minor that they are unlikely to be reliably measured or be of practical importance. Broader dimensions that would span several cells are generally of greater utility in practical applications.

The experimental search for multiple abilities by Guilford and others, combined with the increasing emphasis on educational and vocational guidance since World War II, has resulted in a number of multiaptitude batteries. Although such batteries are intended primarily for guidance purposes, they also can be useful in individualizing instruction and in planning courses that utilize a broader range of human abilities. As noted earlier, school learning is largely verbal learning regardless of the course. The differential testing of abilities provides an opportunity to develop learning experiences that take advantage of each individual's total pattern of aptitudes.

Multiaptitude batteries that measure both educational and vocational aptitudes have been designed primarily for the high sd1001level and beyond. Among the most widely used tests of this type are the *Differential Aptitude Tests* (DAP~') *(grades* &-12), the *Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB),* and the *General Aptitude Test Battery (GAm).* The *ASVAB* is used in screening and counseling enlisted personnel for the military selvices. It is also made available for use in high school counseling programs. The *GAm*  was developed by the federal government for lise in offices of the United States Employment Selvice (USES). It can be given in high schools, however, by special ammgement with USES. The *GAm* contains more vocationally oriented tests than the *DATTM* or *ASVAB.* 

Here we describe the *DATTM* in order to illustrate the nature and content of multiaptitude batteries. Information concerning other batteries available for use in the schools can be obtained from the *Mental Measm'ements Yearbooks.* 

##### *Differential Aptitude Tests (DAT  TM)**

The first edition of the *DApM* battery was published shortly after World War II (947) by the Psychological Corporation. The most recent version, the fifth edition, was published in 1990. The fifth edition includes eight tests, each measuring a separate set of abilities. Although some of the tests measure abilities specific enough to fit a particular cell in Guilford's model (see Figure 17.5), most measure a composite of abilities that have been found useful in educational and vocational guidance. The eight tests are Verbal Reasoning (VR), Numerical Reasoning (NR), Abstract Reasoning (AR), Perceptual Speed and Accuracy (PSA), Mechanical Reasoning (MR), Space Relations (SR), Spelling (S), and Language Usage(LU). In addition to seperate scores for each of these tests a combined Verbal Reasoning and Numerical Reasoning score (VR + NR) provides an index of scholastic aptitude.

The Verbal Reasoning and Numerical Reasoning subtests are also available for administration alone in what is called the partial battery. Sample items from the eight tests are shown in Figure 17.6. Using a battery of aptitude tests like the *DA'JT*M has several advantages over using a selies of separate tests covering the same areas. First, because all tests have been standardized on the same population, it is possible to compare a student's strengths and weaknesses on the various measures of aptitude. Second, because all tests are built for the same population of users, they are matd1ed in difficulty and appropriateness for the grade levels for which they are intended. Separate tests covering the same areas are apt to range widely in difficulty, especially the vocational tests. Third, using a common test format and uniform testing procedures for all tests simplifies test administration.

The tests in the *DA'J'T*M tend to be internally consistent (split-half reliabilities average about .90), and the intercorrelations between tests are low enough (average about .50) to indicate that each test measures a relatively independent ability. The evidence of differential prediction, however, is rather disappointing. One might expect the Verbal Reasoning scores to best predict English achievement, the Numerical Reasoning scores to best predict mathematics and sdence achievement, the Space Relations scores to best predict achieven1ent in med1anical drawing, and so on. A review of the extensive data presented in the test manual, however, reveals only slight differences in prediction from one area to another. The best predictor of school marks in all courses turned out to be the general ability measure, VR + NR.

#### SUMMARY

Standardized aptitude tests are designed to predict future performance in some activity, such as school learning. Like achievement tests, aptitude tests measure learned abilities. They differ from achievement tests, however, in that the test content is broader in scope, and test performance is less dependent on any spedfic set of learning experiences. This makes it possible to use the tests with students of vaqing educational backgrounds and to predict perfonnance over a wide range of learning activities.

Group tests of learning ability (or scholastic aptitude) may yield a single score, separate verbal and nonverbal scores, separate verbal and quantitative scores, or several scores based on a series of specific a ptitudes. The single-score test is designed to measure general learning ability only. In tests using verbal and nonverbal scores, the nonverbal score serves as a check on the learning ability of the poor reader. Tests with separate verbal and quantitative scores are used primarily for differential prediction. Which type of test to choose depends largely on the type of information desired and the use for which it is intended. For stra.ightforward prediction of school success, a single-score test may suffice, but for helping students with learning problems and educational choices, tests with two or more scores are desirable.

Individual tests of learning ability deemphasize reading skill and provide more carefully controlled testing conditions. Thus, the individual test is especially valuable for testing young children and for checking on questionable scores obtained with group tests. Although extensive training and experience are required to administer individual tests, classroom teachers will likely encounter the scores on school records. It is therefore desirabie to know the nature of the test content and the types of scores that are conunonly used.

Most group and individual tests of learning ability report test perfonnance in tenns of standard scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. In interpreting and using the scores, it is importa.nt to allow for normal variation due to error, to seek causes of low scores, to verify the scores by comparison to other information, to use the results to improve learning, and to interpret underacllievement cautiously.

Various attempts have been made to develop culture-fair tests by using nonverbal materials that are interesting and common to many cultures and by using simple procedures and liberal time limits. Although the instruments have not lived up to expectations, they have helped clarify the problems involved.

Comprehensive aptitude batteries, such as the *Differential Aptitude Tests (DAJTM),*  have also been developed for school use. These tests include reasoning ability tests as well as vocationally oriented tests.

### CHAPTER 18: TEST SELECTION, ADMINISTRATION, AND USE**

P UbliShed tests play an impoltant role in the instmctional program of the school. They supplement and complement informal classroom tests and aid in many instructional decisions. The task for schools is to locate and select those tests that are most suitable , administer and score them under carefully controlled conditions, and make effective use of the results.

There are many published tests available for school use. The two types of most value to the instructional program of the school are the achievement tests and aptitude tests discussed in the last two chapters. There are hundreds of tests of ead1 type, so great care is needed in seieciing those tests thai are most reievant to the objectives of the schooi program and most appropriate for the uses to be made of the results.

Some published tests are selected by individual teachers, but more frequently the tests are selected in accordance witl1 the district or state testing program. Some states or districts may require the administration of an off-the-shelf published test, while others, particularly in the case of states, may require the administration of a test that has been developed or customized by a publisher to align with the state's content standards. Even when the adoption or development is controlled by the state or district, teachers still should have a voice in the selection process, either through direct service on a test committee or through departmental and general staff meetings.

In this chapter, our focus is on published tests, but many of the principles discussed apply equally well to either off-the-shelf published tests or to assessments tl1at are specially developed or customized to meet state content standards. For example , the *Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education* and the *Standards jor Educational and Psychological Testing* are applicable in either type of situation and can provide help in test selection or in the development or review of customized assessments.

It is important that teachers participate actively in the selection of published tests and in the development or review of assessments customized to state or district content standards. Their participation provides greater assurance that the tests are aligned with the objectives of the instructional program and that the results will serve the various instructional uses for which they are intended. Although published tests can serve a variety of administrative and guidance functions, of central concern to any testing program is the effective use of tests in the instructional program.

In addition to familiarity with the procedures for selecting tests, teachers must also know the procedures for administeling tests (see Appendix D, especially standard 3). In some schools, teachers palticipate directly in these functions, whereas in others, special personnel is used. In either case, however, the teacher's understanding of the procedures contributes to more effective interpretation and use of test results.

#### **OBTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLISHED TESTS**

There are many available resources that are useful for locating and evaluating published tests in specific areas (see Table 18.1). These will aid in selecting tests that are most suitable and that are technically sound.

##### **Buros Institute of Mental Measurements Guides**

A basic source of information about tests is the *Mental Measurements Yearbook,* first published in 1938. The *Yearbook* was started and edited by Oscar K. Buros for many years and is now published by the Buros Institute of Mental Measurements of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The *Yearbooks* are published periodically but on no definite schedule. Each *Yearbook* typically includes the following types of material:

- 1. Descriptive information concerning each test
- 2. Critical reviews written by test specialists for the *Yearbook*
- 3. Excerpts from test reviews published in professional journals
- 4. Comprehensive bibliographies for many specific tests
- 5. Listing of measurement books and book reviews

The test reviews in the *Yearbooks* provide especially valuable information for evaluating the quality of published tests. Each test is typically reviewed by two or more specialists qualified by training and experience to evaluate the test. The reviewers often point out test weaknesses as well as any exaggerated claims made by test publishers. They also indicate the strengths of a test and the uses for which it is best suited.

Another useful Buros Institute guide for locating tests and information about tests is *Tests in Print.* This publication includes a descriptive listing of published tests, with extensive bibliographies for some. Although test reviews are not included, each is indexed to those editions of the *Yearbooks* that contain reviews of the test.

As aids for locating tests for a particular lise, *Tests in Print* provides an excellent guide to available tests, and the *Yearbooks* provide the information needed to evaluate them. The cross-references to the *Yearbooks* in *Tests in Print* make it possible to locate numerous reviews for each test.

*Tests in Print* has been published less frequently than the *Yearbooks* and in the event a recent edition is not available, tests can be located by going directly to the *Yearbooks.*  They are fully indexed and contain descriptions of the tests as well as the test reviews. The *Yearbooks* can also be used, of course, for evaluating tests that have been located tl1rough test publishers' catalogs or other sources.

The Buros Institute of Mental Measurements also provides test information through a *Yearbooks* database. This computer database is updated monthly and thus provides the most recent information available (see the box *"Mentat Measurements Yearbooks and On-line Computer* Seroice').

##### *Mental Measurements Yearbooks* and On-Line Computer Service

The Buros Institute of Mental Measurements (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) produces a database that is part of the on-line computer service available. The *Mental Measurements Yearbooks* include reviews of over 2,000 tests. It includes the reviews from the

Buros Institute's 10th through 15th *Mentat Measurements Yearbooks* and is updated every 6 months. For further infonnation on the on-line access to *Yearbook* reviews, go to http://www.unl.edulburos/.

##### **Educational Testing Service (ETS) Test Collection**

The Educational Testing Service (Princeton, New Jersey) developed a Test Collection that contains information about thousands of tests. The ETS Test Collection database is now available through a joint project of ETS and the ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation. The database contains information on over 10,000 tests and research instruments. The database entries include information about the title, author, publication date and source, as well as an abstract that describes the test and intended uses and intended population (e.g., age and grade level). A subset of the collection is available for purchase on microfiche from the test collection. For further information, go to *http:// ericae.net/testcot.htm#ETSTF.* 

##### **Test Publishers' Catalogs**

Recent information concerning tests available for school use also can be obtained from test publishers' catalogs. These usually contain brief descriptions of each test, including possible uses of the test, cost, administration time, and similar infonnation. If a publisher's claims for its tests are checked by independent reviews SUcil as those presented in the *MentalMeasurements Yearbooks,* test catalogs provide a good source of information. They are especially useful for locating new tests and recent editions of earlier tests. A brief list of test publishers who will send catalogs on request is included in Appendix E.

##### **Testing Standards**

An especially useful aid in evaluating and using published tests is the *Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing* (American Educational Research Association, American Psycl1010gical Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999). The *Standards* include recommendations intended for both test publishers and test users. Part I contains standards for test construction, evaluation, and documentation (validity, reliability, test development, norming, scaling, and related issues). Part IT provides standards on fairness in testing (general issues, diverse linguistic backgrounds, and disabilities). Pan III covers standards for the use of tests in various situations (clinical, educational, counseling, employment, professional licensure, and program evaluation). Each standard is followed by a comment used to clarify or justify the reconunendation or to desO'ibe the conditions under which the standard would apply (see the box "Illustrative Test Standard from the 'Validity' Section").

A review of the standards in Pan I provides a good background for selecting and evaiuating tests, and the specific recommendations in Parts II and III provide excelient gUidelines for effective test use.

##### **Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education**

The *Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education* was prepared by a Joint Committee on Testing Practices, a group that was formed in cooperation with several professional associations. The *Code* is intended to apply to a wide range of published tests and tests used in formal administrations that may be developed and reqUired by school districts or

##### Illustrative Test Standard from the "Validity" Section

 Standard 1.1
A rationale should be presented for each recommended interpretation and use of test scores, together with a comprehensive summary of the evidence and theory bearing on the intended use or intelpretation.
 Comment
The rationale should indicate what propositions are necessalY to investigate the intended interpretation. The comprehensive summary should combine logical analysis with empirical evidence to provide support for the test rationale. Evidence may come from studies conducted locally, in the setting where the test is to be used; from specific prior studies; or from comprehensive statistical syntheses of available snldies meeting clearly specified criteria. No type of evidence is inherently preferable to others; rather, the quality and relevance of the evidence to the intended test use determine the value of a particular kind of evidence. A presentation of empirical evidence on any point should give due weight to all relevant findings in the sdentific literature, including those inconsistent with the intended interpretation or use. Test developers have the responsibility to provide support for their own recommendations, but test users are responsible for evaluating the quality of the validity evidence provided and its relevance to the local situation.

states. The code is not intended to apply to tests developed by individual teachers for use in their own classrooms.

The *Code* is intended for two primary audiences: test users and test developers. Test users are defined as "people who select tests, commission test development selvices, or make decisions on the basis of test scores." The *Code* presents standards in four areas: (a) developing and selecting appropriate tests, (b) administering and scorirlg tests, (c) reporting and interpreting test results, and (d) informing test takers. Eacll of these sections of the *Code* is discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter and in Chapter 19.

##### **Other Sources of Test Information**

Test reviews and information concerning the nature and use of particular tests can frequently be found in professional journals (see list ill Appendix B). Journal articles can be most easily located tllroUgh the use of SUcll bibliographic sources as the *Current Index toJournals in Education,* the *Education Index,* and *PsychotogicalA bstracts.* In using these guides, it is usually necessary to search under many different headings, such as aptitude testing, achievement testing, psychological tests, reading tests, tests and scales, and testing programs. In locating information on tests in a spedfic content area, it also may be necessary to look under tllat subject in a specific content area (e.g., English or science). Test reviews in professional journals can be most easily located by a computerized literature search.

Some textbooks in educational and psychological measurement include descriptions and evaluations of widely used tests and contain selected lists of tests in an appendix. Also, some textbooks in particular areas (e.g., reading or special education) describe tests that are especially useful in those areas. Although textbooks provide descriptive information concerning representative tests, this is useful mainly for orientation to the field of testing. Test selection for a particular situation includes a study of the situation to detern1ine testing needs, searching for possible tests, consulting test reviews, and examining the test manuals and other test materials of the most likely prospects.

#### **SELECTING APPROPRIATE TESTS**

Published tests play an important role in the educational program of the school and therefore should be selected with utmost care. When carefully selected and appropriately used , they can make a valuable contribution to instructional planning and student learning. On the other hand, hastily or casually selected tests seldom are in hannony with the objectives of the instructional program and thus may provide inadequate or inappropriate information on which to base educational decisions. Even when selected with care, however, the value of the information depends on the way in which it is used. Misinterpretations (e.g., assuming that pelformance on an aptitude test is an indication of innate capacity) and misuses (e.g., placement of students in remedial programs based solely on low test performance) can have serious negative consequences. The following sequence of steps provides general guidelines for a systematic approach to test seiection. Issues regarding the use and interpretation of resuits are considered in a subsequent section of this chapter.

##### **Defining Testing Needs**

The first task in selecting published tests is to define specifically the purpose of testing and the type of information being sought through testing. *As* is emphasized by the first standard for test users in the *Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education* (see Table 18.2), it is critical that purpose be clearly defined and that the test match the purpose. In selecting achievement tests, for example, it is insufficient to search for a test to evaluate "achievement in social studies" or to measure "reading comprehension." There are numerous tests in any given content area, and each measures somewhat different aspects of knowledge, understanding, and skill. To make a proper selection, we must first identify the objectives and specific learning outcomes of our instructional program. This is necessary in choosing relevant tests, whether selecting a single test for a particular course or a battery of tests for a schoolwide testing program.

Clarifying the type of information needed is equally necessalY in selecting aptitude tests. It makes a difference whether we are going to use the results for determining reading readiness, for grouping students, for vocational planning, or for predicting success in science and mathematics courses. Eacl1 function requires different information and consequently a different type of aptitude measure. Thus, selection must be preceded by an analysis of the intended use of the results and tl1e type of test data most appropriate for ead1 use.

##### **Narrowing the Choice**

The need for published tests *is* usually considered in relation to the total measurement program. This makes it possible to choose tests that supplement and complement the other means of assessing students. It *is* desirable to choose a test of general educational development, for example, if certain learning outcomes in the knowledge area already are being adequately measured by informal classroom tests and assessments. Similarly, if a scholastic aptitude test *is* to be used at a particular grade level for identifying students needing extra help in learning to read, it *is* best to replace the aptitude test wid1 a diagnostic reading test. Such decisions can be made only when the need for testing is viewed in terms of the total measurement program.

Other factors in the school situation also help narrow the choice. If, for instance , the school lacks a person with the training and experience required to administer individual tests, only group tests should be considered. If the tests are to be administered by teachers without experience in test administration, tests with simple directions are best. If the same type of achievement battery is desired for both the elementary and the high school level, only those batteries with tests at all grade levels need to be examined. Considerations such as these offer additional criteria for determining the types of tests to seek.

Although reputable test publishers work hard to eliminate materials that are offensive to different groups of test takers, avoid stereotypes, and in other ways make the material as fair as possible for test takers of different races, gender, or ethnic backgrounds, it is also important that test users review potential tests for possible sources of unfairness. Useful guidelines in mis regard from the *Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education* are reproduced in Table 18.3.

##### **Locating Suitable Tests**

When the needs for testing have been identified, a list of possible tests can be compiled from test publishers' catalogs and the most recent edition of the *Mental Measurements Yearbook.* The reviews in these guides are sufficiently detailed to weed out those tests that are clearly inappropriate or that have obvious technical weaknesses. Further evaluative information also can be found in other sources, such as those described earlier.

##### **Obtaining Specimen Sets**

When the list of tests has been reduced to a reasonable number, specimen sets should be obtained so that test manuals and the test items memselves can be evaluated. Test publishers generally supply specimen sets for each test they publish.

These can be purchased at relatively low cost and include a test manual, a test booklet, and scoring keys. Many universities, colleges, and large school systems maintain a file of such spedmen sets.

##### Reviewing Test Materials

The test manual (sometimes accompanied by a technical manual and related aids) usually provides the most complete information for judging the appropriateness and the technical qualities of a test. A good test manual includes the following types of information.

- 1. Uses for which the test is recommended
- 2. Qualifications needed to administer and interpret the test
- 3. Evidence of validity for each recommended use
- 4. Evidence of reliability for recommended uses and an indication of equivalence for any equivalent fOlms provided
- 5. Directions for administering and scoring the test
- 6. Adequate norms (including a description of the procedures used in obtaining them) or other bases for interpreting the scores

Some test manuals (or supplements to the manuals) also contain suggestions and guides for interpreting and using the results. These are especially helpful for determining the functions for which the test is best suited.

In addition to reviewing the test manual, it is also wise to study the individual test items. The best method of doing this is to try to answer eacll item as if you were taking the test. For adlievement tests, it is also helpful to classify the items by means of a previously prepared table of specifications or other test plan. Although the process is time consuming, there is no better means of determining how appropriate a test is for measuring the knowledge, skills, and understanding emphasized in the instructional program.

##### Using a Test Evaluation Form

Gathering information about specific tests is made easier if a test evaluation fonn is used. This provides a convenient means of recording significant data, it inaÂ·eases the likelihood that pel1inent information will not be overlooked, and it provides for a summary comparison of each test's stl"engths and weaknesses (see the box "Test Evaluation Form").

- **Recommendations concerning local use**


Although a test evaluation form provides a useful SUllUllalY of information concerning tests, no test should be selected on the basis of this information alone. How well a test fits the school program and the particular uses for which it is being considered are always the main considerations.

#### **ADMINISTERING PUBLISHED TESTS**

Most group tests of achievement and scholastic aptitude can be successfully administered by any conscientious teaciler. The main requirement is that the testing procedures prescribed in the test manual be rigorously followed. To do this, it is necessary to shift from being a teacher and helper to being an impartial test examiner who will not deviate from the test directions.

Teachers sometimes wonder why it is important to follow the test procedures so closely. What harm is there in helping students if they do not understand patticular questions? Why not give the students a little more time if they are almost finished? Aren't some of the directions nit-picking, anyway? The answer is:

 A *published test must be administered under standard conditions if the results are to be meaningfully interpreted.*

When a published, norm-referenced test is given to a national sample of students to establish norms, it is administered in exact accordance with the procedures prescribed in the test manual. Unless teachers adhere strictly to the same procedures, the standard conditions of measurement will be violated: and the test norms cannot legitimately be used to interpret scores. Although not all published criterion-referenced tests have norms, the interpretation of the results according to an absolute standard (e.g., mastely-nonmastelY) also depends on controlled conditions of administration. In shott, when we alter the procedures for administering a published test, we lose the basis for a meaningful interpretation of the scores.

##### **Test Administration**

The administration of group tests is relatively Simple: (a) Motivate students to do their best, (b) follow the directions closely, (c) keep time accurately, (d) record any significant events that might influence test scores, and (e) collect tile materials promptly.

**1.** Motivate the students. In testing, our goal should be to obtain maximum performance within ilie standard conditions set forth in the testing procedures. We want all students to earn as high a score as they are capable of achieving. This obviously means mat they must be motivated to put forth their best effort. Altll0ugh some students will respond to any test as a challenge to their ability, others will not work seriously at the task unless they are convinced that the test results will be beneficial to them. In scl1001 testing, we can stimulate students to put forth their best effort by convincing them that tile test results will be used primarily to help them improve tlleir leaming. We can also explain to them the value of tile test results for understanding tllemselves better and for planning their future. But these need to be more than hollow promises. Test results must be used in such a way that tllese benefits are clearly evident to tlle students.

Before administering a particular test, the teacher should explain to students the purpose of the test and the uses to be made of the results (see Table 18.4). At this time , the teacher should emphasize the advantages of obtaining a score that represents the students' best efforts but should not make the students overly anxious. Verbal reassurance that the size of the score is not as important as the fact that it represents one 's best effort is usually helpful. The judicious use of humor can also offset test anxiety. The most effective remedy, however, is a positive attiUlde toward test results. When the students are convinced that valid test scores are beneficial to their own welfare , both their test anxiety and motivation tend to become minor problems.

With the recent growth in statewide testing, student motivation on standardized tests has been a major concern for teachers, schools, and parents. Many schools have begun to use external motivation techniques that include posters, pep rallies, and the like; however, internal motivation of students (Le., motivating SUI dents to perform well because they understand the importance of the test and they want to do well) is the

 Table 18.4

##### Standards for informing test takers

Under some circumstances, test developers have direct communication with the test takers and/or control of the tests, testing process, and test results. In other circumstances the test users have these responsibilities.

Test developers or test users should inform test takers about the nature of the test, test taker rights and responsibilities, the appropriate use of scores, and procedures for resolving challenges to scores.

- D-1 Inform test takers in advance of the test administration about the coverage of the test, the type of question formats, the directions, and appropriate test-taking strategies. Make such information available to all test takers.
- D-2. When a test is optional, provide test takers or their parents/guardians with information to help them judge whether a test should be taken-including indications of any consequences that may result from not taking the test (e.g., not being eligible to compete for a particular scholarship)-and whether there is an available alternative to the test.
- D-3. Provide test takers or their parents/guardians with information about rights test takers may have to obtain copies of tests and completed answer sheets, to retake tests, to have tests rescored, or to have scores declared invalid.
- D-4. Provide test takers or their parents/guardians with information about responsibilities test takers have, such as being aware of the intended purpose and uses of the test, performing at capacity, following directions, and not disclosing test items or interfering with other test takers.
- D-5. Inform test takers or their parents/guardians how long scores will be kept on file and indicate to whom, under what circumstances, and in what manner test scores and reiated information wiii or wiii not be released. Protect test scores from unauthorized release and access.
- D-6. Describe procedures for investigating and resolving circumstances that might result in canceling or withholding scores, such as failure to adhere to specified testing procedures.
- D-7. Describe procedures that test takers, parents/guardians, and other interested parties may use to obtain more information about the test, register complaints, and have problems resolved.

more effective method for achieving good results. Therefore, students must recognize the importance of the test and remain confident in their ability to perform their best.

2. Follow directions strictly. The impOltance of following the directions given in the test manual cannot be overemphasized. Unless the test is administered in exact accordance with the standard directions, the test results will contain an indeterminate amount of en"Or and thereby prevent proper interpretation and use. The test directions should be read word for word in a loud, clear voice. They should never be paraphrased, reated from memolY, or modified in any way. The oral reading of directions will usually be more effective if the directions have been practiced beforehand.

After the directions have been read and during the testing period, some students are likely to ask questions. It is usually permissible to clarify the directions and to answer questions concerning mechanics (e.g., how to record the answer), but the test manual must be your gUide. If it is permissible to clarify the directions, you should not change or modify the directions in any way during your explanation. Some teachers find it hard to refrain from helping students who are having difficulty answering items on a published test. When questioned about a particular test item, they are tempted to say, "You remember, we discussed that last week," or give similar hints to the students. This merely distOlts the results. When asked about a particular test item during testing, the teacher should quietly tell the student, "I'm sony, but I cannot help you. Do the best you can."

3. Keep time accurately. If a series of short subtests must be timed separately, it is desirable to use a stopwatch when giving the test. For most other purposes, a watch with a second hand is satisfactoly. To ensure accurate timing, keep a written record of the starting and stoping time the exact hour, m inute and second as follows

|               | Hour | Minute | Second |
|---------------|------|--------|--------|
| Starting Time | 2    | 10     | o      |
| Time Allowed  |      | 12     |        |
| Stopping Time | 2    | 22     | o      |

4. Record significant events. The students should be carefully observed during testing and a record made of any unusual behavior or event t11at might influence the test scores. If, for example, a student appears overly tense and anxious, sits staring out of the wirldow for a time, or seems to be marking answers randomly without reading the questions, a description of the behavior should be recorded . Similarly, if there are interruptions during the testing (despite your careful planning) a record should be made of type and length of the interruption and whetller it did or did not alter the testing conditions. A record of unusual student behavior and significant events provides valuable infonnation for determirling whether test scores are representative of the students' best efforts and whetller standard conditions have been maintained during testirlg. Questionable test scores should, of course, be recllecked by administering a second form of the test.

5. Collect test materials promptly. When the test has ended, all test materials should be collected promptly so that students cannot work beyond the time limits and so that all materials can be accounted for and secured.

For those responsible for the testing program, from the ordering of the tests to their administration, the box "Test Giver's Checklist" summarizes the points that need to be considered.

##### Improving Students' Test-Taking Skills
Our suggestions for test administration, as summarized in the "Test Giver's Checklist," emphasize the importance of establishing the most suitable environment for the test taker

Test Giver's Checklist

 1. Order and check test materials well in advance of the testing date.
- a. Were correct forms of the test sent?
- b. Is there the right number of tests and answer sheets?
- c. Have all needed materials been assembled (pencils, watch, etc.)?
- d. Have all test materials been securely stored until the testing date?

 2. Select a suitable location for testing.
- a. Is there adequate work space?
- b. Is the lighting, heat, and ventilation satisfactory?
- c. Is the room in a quiet location?
- d. Is the seating arrangement satisfactory?

 3. Take steps to prevent distractions.
- a. Will a "Testing in Progress" sign be posted on the door?
- b. Will all needed materials be on hand before starting?
- c. Have arrangements been made to eliminate distractions (e.g., bells)?
- d. Has the test been scheduled to avoid major school events?

 4. Study the test materials and practice giving the test.
- a. Did you carefully read the test manual?
- b. Did you take the test yourself?
- c. Did you practice reading the directions?
- d. Did you anticipate questions students might ask?

 5. Motivate the students.
- a. Was the purpose of the test explained to the students?
- b. Were the students told how the results would be used?
- c. Were the students encouraged to put forth their best effort?
- d. Has care been taken not to create test anxiety?
- e. Is the student adequately prepared to take the test?

 6. Follow test directions strictly and keep time accurately.
- a. Did you read the test directions word for word?
- b. Did you refrain from helping students (except with mechanics)?
- c. Did you make a written record of starting and stopping times?
- d. Did you stick to the exact time schedule?

 7. Record significant events.
- a. Did students do anything that might affect the test results?
- b. Were there any interruptions that might affect the scores?

 8. Collect the test materials promptly when the testing has ended.
- a. Were all test materials collected immediately?
- b. Were the collected materials counted, checked, and secured?

and using methods that motivate the students to put forth their best efforts. Despite these procedures, however, some students might not perform at the level of which they are capable because they lack skill in test taking. It has been suggested by Sarnacki (1979) that all students be given training in test-taking skills to prevent such defidendes from lowering their test scores. This seems to be a sensible suggestion and one that could be easily handled in the regular classroom or through the use of programmed materials. Among the skills important in test taking are the following:

- 1. Listening to or reading directions carefully
- 2. Listening to or reading test items carefully
- 3. Setting a pace that will allow time to complete the test
- 4. Bypassing difficult items and returning to them later
- 5. Making informed guesses rather than omitting items
- 6. Eliminating as many alternatives as possible on multiple-choice items before guessing
- 7. Following directions carefully in marking the answer sheet (e.g. , darken the entire space)
- 8. Checking to be sllre the item number and answer number match when marking an answer
- 9. Checking to be sllre that the appropriate response was marked on the answer sheet
- 10. Going back and checking the answers if time permits

Test-taking skills such as these can be easily mastered, but students need practice to develop them.Fortunately many test publishers now provide practice test that can be given before the regular test. This is of some help, but special training in test taking will provide even greater assurance that a student's test scores are not depressed by deficiencies in test-taking skills.

##### **Unsound and Unethical Test Preparation Practices**

Although it is important to take steps such as those discussed here to help students be ready to do dleir best when taking tests, it is easy to go overboard. Espedally in high-stakes testing situations, where teachers are under great pressure to get dleir students to score high, it is natural to focus more and more attention on the contents of the test. Unfortunately, this can lead to poor instructional practices and inflated test scores.

In some schools, teachers devote the majority of their instructional time for several weeks to practice for the high-stakes test. Such practice ignores important learning objectives that are not on the test and is not even a sound pedagogical approach for the objectives that are covered by the test. Moreover, when the practice materials match the actual test too closely, the result can be improved test scores without improved achievement. As a consequence, the scores give an inflated impression of ilie students' overall achievement.

Occasionally, dle actual items that appear on a test become the focus of instmction. Providing practice on ilie actual test items before administration of a sta ndardized test invalidates the results. It is an unethical practice.

#### **USING RESULTS OF** PUBLISHED TESTS

Published achievement and learning ability tests can serve many different purposes in the Sd1001's educational program. Here we describe briefly some of the possible uses and misuses of published tests that are of special interest to teachers.

##### Possible Uses of Published Tests

If they are selected and used with discretion , published tests of achievement and ability can play an impOltant role in the school's evaluation program. Tests should be selected in accordance with the school's o bjectives and the purposes for which the results are to be used. When selected in this manner, they can contlibute to more effective educational decisions in a number of areas.

Instructional PlalUling. Published tests of ad1ievement and learning ability can aid instructional planning in a particular school or course in the following ways.

1. Identifying the level and range of ability among students. Among other things, instructional plans must take into account the students' learning ability and their present levels of achievement. Published tests can provide objective evidence on both of these points.

2. Identifying areas of instmction needing greate r emphasis. If the published tests have been selected in accordance with the school's objectives, instlUCtional weaknesses will be revealed by those areas of the test in whid 1 the students do poorly. Published tests are especially helpful in appraising strengths and weaknesses in learning (see Table 18.5).

**TABLE-Percentage of teachers using standardized achievement test results in various ways**

3. Identifying discrepancies between learning ability and achievement. Although differences between learning ability and achievement must be interpreted with caution, large discrepancies can aid in identifying students who may be underachieving. In this as well as other areas, however, the results of published tests should be verified by other available evidence.

CourseSmart

4. Diagnosing learning errors and planning remedial instruction. Published diagnostic tests are especially useful for pinpointing the learning errors that are handicapping a student's learning progress. Published tests provide a more systematic approach than informal methods, and the manuals typically provide suggestions for remediation. Unfortunately, these tests are limited almost entirely to the basic skills of reading and mathematics.

5. Clarifying and selecting instructional objectives. The use of published tests aids in the clarification and selection of objectives in several ways. First, selecting the tests forces us to identify and state our objectives as clearly as possible. Second, an examination of the items in published tests tells us how different objectives function in testing. As we go back and forth (during test selection) between our objectives and the items in the tests under consideration, what a particular objective looks like in operational terms becomes clearer. Third, the results of published tests provide evidence that helps in selecting objectives at a particular grade level or in a particular course. If fall test results indicate that students in the sixth grade are weak in study skills, for example, sixth-grade teachers may want to include an objective in this area, even though they had not originally planned to devote much attention to study skills. Similarly, published test results might indicate that a particular objective is unnecessary because it has been satisfactorily achieved at an earlier grade level.

Individualizing Instruction. In any classroom, there are substantial individual differences in aptitude and achievement. Thus, it is necessary to study the strengths and weaknesses of each student in class so that instruction can be adapted as much as possible to individual learning needs. For this purpose (a) scholastic aptitude tests provide clues concerning learning ability, (b) reading tests indicate the difficulty of material the student can read and understand, (c) norm-referenced achievement tests point out general areas of strength and weakness, (d) criterion-referenced achievement tests describe how well specific tasks are being mastered, and (e) diagnostic tests aid in detecting and overcoming specific learning errors.

Criterion-referenced tests are especially well adapted to individualizing instruction because each set of test items is keyed to a specific objective. This makes it possible for a student to proceed through a given learning sequence by demonstrating mastery of the objectives one by one. Many publishers also provide references to books and other learning aids to guide the individual study of students who have failed to master a particular objective.

Identifying the Needs of Exceptional Children. Some students deviate so markedly from students at their grade or age level that special instructional programs are needed. The gifted, mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, and physically handicapped and similar exceptional children fall into this category. For this student, published tests are helpful in identifying problems of learning and development so that special provisions can be made for meeting exceptional needs. This use of tests is growing in importance now that inclusion and mainstreaming (placing children with handicapping conditions in the least-restrictive environment) have increased the number of exceptional children in regular classrooms. Mainstreaming and inclusion emphasize the importance of each handicapped student having a detailed individualized educational program.

Monitoring of Educational Progress over Extended Periods. Published tests are especially useful in measuring learning progress over a given number of years. Comparable forms make it possible to measure the same learning outcomes annually and thus obtain a long-range picture of the students' educational development. Teacher-made tests are not as useful for this purpose because of the lack of uniformity from one year to the next.

In using published tests as a basis for determining students' educational development, care must be taken not to overgeneralize from the results. Tests that yield comparable measures of general educational progress throughout the school years must, of necessity, be confined to learning that is continuously developing and that is common to diverse curricula. In the main, this means the basic skills and critical abilities used in the interpretation and application of ideas that cut across subject-matter lines. Although these are significant learning outcomes, they are only a partial indication of total educational development. Knowledge and understanding of specific content, skills unique to each subject field, attitudes and appreciation, and similar learning outcomes that cannot be measured by survey tests of educational development are equally important.

Providing Parents with an Independent Source of Information. Teacher reports regarding student achievement and grades assigned provide parents with the most important information about the educational progress of their children. Standardized test results, however, are a useful supplement to teacher reports. They have the advantage of being independent of teacher opinions. Normative information also provides a comparison against a wider context than that provided by an individual classroom or school.

Helping Students Make Educational and Vocational Choices. At the high school level, published test results can contribute to more intelligent educational and vocational decisions. In deciding which curriculum to pursue, which courses to take, whether to plan for college, or which occupations to consider, students can be aided greatly by knowing their aptitudes and their strengths and weaknesses in achievement. Published tests are especially useful in educational and vocational planning because they indicate to students how they compare with persons beyond the local school situation. This is important because these are the persons with whom they will be competing after leaving high school.

Supplementary Uses. In addition to the preceding uses of published tests, all of which are directly concerned with improving students' instruction and guidance, there are a number of supplementary uses to which they can be put, including (a) placing students transferred from other schools, (b) appraising the general effectiveness of the school program in developing basic skills, (c) identifying areas in the educational program in which supervisory aid and in-service training can be used most effectively, (d) evaluating new educational programs, (e) providing evidence for interpreting the school program to

the public, and CD gathering inforn1ation for reports to other schools, colleges, and prospective employers. When published test results are presented to individuals and groups outside the school, it should be emphasized that these tests measure only some of the objectives of the school program.

##### **Misuses of Published Tests**

Published tests can be misused in any of the preceding areas if (a) there is inadequate attention to the educational objectives being measured, (b) there is a failure to recognize the limited position of tests in the total assessment program, (c) there is unquestioning faith in the test results, or (d) the group tested is markedly different from the group for whom the test was intended. These factors contribute to the misapplication and misinterpretation of published test results in any situation. In addition, three misuses warrant special attention.

Assignment of Course Grades. Some teachers use the scores from published tests as a basis for assigning course grades. This is undesirable for at least two reasons: (1) Published tests are seldom closely related to the instmctional objectives of a particular course, and (2) they measure only a portion of the desired learning outcomes emphasized in instruction. Using these tests for grading purposes tends to overemphasize a limited number of ill-fitting objectives. In addition to the unfairness to the student, this practice by the tests.

In borderline cases, especially when promotion or retention is being decided, published test results can be a valuable supplement. Knowing a student's scholastic aptitude and general level of educational development contributes to a more intelligent decision concerning the best grade placement. Except for such special uses, however, published tests should playa minor role, if any, in determining course grades.

Assignment of Remedial Track or Retention in Grade Solely on the Basis of a Test Score. Although test results can contribute to informed decisions regarding student placement in special programs, they are not adequate for such decisions when used in isolation. Information about a student's background and prior learning experiences needs to be considered. Teacher observations of classroom behavior and performance are also relevant considerations. Moreover, there should be compelling reasons to believe that students placed in special instmctional programs or reqUired to repeat a grade will be likely to learn more than they would in a normal class and sequence. It should be noted that researcl1 suggests remedial tracks frequently *do* **flot** lead to improved learning and that students who are retained in grade seldom benefit more than they would if promoted (Shepard & Smith, 1989).

Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness. In some schools, teacher effectiveness is judged by the scores students make on published tests. This is an extremely unfair practice because so many factors other than teaching effectiveness influence test scores. Many of these, such as the class's level of ability, the students' cultural background, the students' educaUonal experiences, and the relative difficulty of learning different course materials, cannot be controlled or equated with sufficient accuracy to justify inferring that the results are solely, or even lafgely, based on the teacher's efforts. Even if such factofs could be contfolled, published test fesults would be a pOOf criterion of teaching success because they afe not closely felated to the instructional objectives of particular courses and they measure only a portion of the learning outcomes tea chefs strive fOf in their instruction. At most, they should play only a minor role in teacllef evaluation.

An especially undesirable side effect of using published tests as the sole or main measure of teaching effectiveness is that some teachers will obtain copies of the test and start teaching students the answers to specific test items. Although this unprofessional practice may begin with a few unethical teachefs, subtle pressures (to avoid looking ineffective by comparison) soon cause the practice to spread. Such "teaching for the test," of course, not only distorts the measures of teaching effectiveness but also invalidates the test scores for other school uses.

#### **SUMMARY**

Teachers should know how to locate, select, administer, interpret, and use published tests. This contributes to more effective use of the test results in the instructional program. One of the most useful sources for locating and evaluating tests is provided by the Buros Institute for Mental Measurements *(Mental Measurements Yearbooks* and *Tests in Print).Both sets of publications provide comprehensive coverage o f available tests. Other  sources include the ETS Test Collection, *News on Tests,* test publishers' catalogs, and vafious professional journals and textbooks. The *Standards* helps determine what to look for in evaluating a test, the test manual provides useful information for the evaluation, and the *Yearbooks* provide cfitical reviews by measurement experts.

To ensure that the most appropriate tests afe selected, a systematiC procedure should be followed. This includes (a) defining the specific type of testing information needed, (b) appraising the role of published tests in felation to other measurement procedures and to the practical constraints of the Scll001 situation, (c) locating suitable tests through the vafious guides and test publishefs' catalogs, (d) obtaining specimen sets of those tests that seem most approptiate, (e) reviewing the test materials in light of their intended uses, and (f) summarizing the data and making a final selection. A summary of data concerning each test under consideration is Simplified if a standard evaluation form is used when compiling the information.

Administration of published tests involves careful preparation beforehand and strict adherence to the set procedures duting testing. In preparing for testing, (a) order and check the materials well in advance, (b) select a suitable location for testing, (c) make provisions to pfevent distractions, and (d) practice administering the test. During test administration, (a) closely follow the directions and time limits, (b) encourage the students to do their best, and (c) keep a record of any event during the testing period that might affect the test scores. Test results are more likely to be valid if questionable scores afe checked by administering a second form of the test and students are given training in test-taking skills.

Published test results can serve a number of useful purposes in the school. They can aid in instructional planning, individualizing instruction, identifying the needs of exceptional children, monitoring educational progress over extended periods, reporting to parents, making educational and vocational decisions, and appraising and reporting on the effectiveness of the school program. In general, they should not be used for assigning course grades, as the sole basis for assignment to remedial programs or retention in grade, or as the sole or main basis for evaluating teaching effectiveness. Published tests are not closely enough related to the instructional objectives of particular courses, and they measure too limited a sampling of the intended learning outcomes to be useful for these purposes. Using published test results to judge a teacher's effectiveness may lead to "teaching for the test" and invalidate the test scores for other school uses.

### **CHAPTER 19: INTERPRETING TEST SCORES AND NORMS**

T est results Gln be imerpreted in terms of the types of tasks that can be performed (criterion reference or standards based) or the relative position held in some reference group (norm reference). Both rypes of interpretation are useful. The first descIibes what a person can do, and the second describes how the performance compares with that of others. "tandardizecl tests traditionally emphasized nonn-referenced interpretation, but many now include both types of infonnation. Interpreting test scores with the aid of norms requires an understanding of the variOllS methods of expressing test scores and a clear grasp of the nature of the norm group. Criterion-referenced or standards-based interpretations require analysis by content cluster or content and performance standards.

Test interpretation would be greatly simplified if we could express test scores on scales like those used in physical measurement. We know, for example, that "5 feet" means the same height whetller we are talking about the height of a boy or a picket fence, that a 20o-pound football player weighs exactly twice as much as a lOO-pound cross-countly runner, and that 8 minutes is exactly one third as long as 24 minutes whether we are timing a standardized test or a basketball game. This ability to compare measurements from one situation to another and to speak in terms of "twice as much as" or "one third as long as" is possible because these physical measures are based on scales that have a true zero poim and equal units.

The true zero point (Le., the point at which there is no height at all or no weight at all) indicates precisely where measurement begins. The equal units (e.g., feet, pounds, or minutes) provide uniform meaning from one situation to another and from one part of the scale to another. Ten pounds indicates the same weight to a doctor, a grocer, a farmer, or a homemaker. The difference between 15 and 25 pounds is exactly the same as the difference between 160 anel 170 pounds.



UnfOltunately, the properties of physical measuring scales with which we all are so familiar are generally lacking in educational measurement. A student who receives a score of zero on a history test does not have zero lmowledge of histOlY; there are probably many simple questions that could be answered correctly but were not included in the test. A true zero point in achievement, where there is no achievement at all, cannot be clearly established. Even if it could, it would be impractical to start from that point each time we tested. What we do in actual practice is assume a certain amount of basic knowledge and measure from there. This arbitrary starting paint, however, prevents us from saying that a zero score indicates no achievement at all or that a score of 100 represents twice the achievement of a score of 50. Because we are never certain how far the zero score on our test is from the true zero point (i.e., the point of no achievement at all), test scores cannot be interpreted in the same way as physical measurements. We can speak of more or less of a given characteristic but not twice as much as or half as much as.

The interpretation of test results is additionally handicapped by the inequality of our units of measurement. SiA'ty items correct on a simple vocabulary test does not have the same meaning as 60 items correct on a more difficult one, nor does either of the scores represent the same level of achievement as 60 items conÂ·ect on a test of mathematics, science, or study skills. Test items simply do not represent equal units sllch as feet, pounds, and minutes.

To overcome this lack of a definite frame of reference in educational measurement, a variety of methods of expressing test scores have been devised . As we will see shortly, the methods valY conSiderably in the extent to which they provide satisfactOlY units of measurement. Much of our difficulty in the interpretation and use of test results is becausewe have so many different scoring systems each with its own peculiar characteristics and  limitations.

It is impOltant that teachers understand the various types of score reports not only for their own use but also so that they can help parents understand the appropriate interpretations of the scores. As indicated in the discussion following standard 3 of the "Standards for Teacher Competence in Educational Assessment of Students," teacl1ers "should be able to interpret commonly repOlted scores: [such as) percentile ranks, percentile band scores, standard scores, and grade equivalents" (see Appendix C).

#### **METHODS OF INTERPRETING TEST SCORES**

##### **Raw Scores**

If a student responds correctly to 65 items on an objective test in which each correct item counts as 1 pOint, the raw score will be 65. Thus, a raw score is simply the number of points received on a test when the test has been scored according to the directions. It does not make any difference whether each item is counted as 1 pOint, whether the items are weighted in some way, or whether a correction for guessing is applied; the resulting point score is still known as a raw score. We all are familiar with raw scores from our many years of taking classroom tests.

Although a raw score is a numerical summary of a student's test performance, it is not very meaningful without fulther infom1ation. If we are told that Michael Adams answered 35 items correctly on a mathematics test and therefore has a raw score of 35, our response is likely to be a question: "What does a 35 mean?" or "Is that a good score?" We might also have a list of more specific questions: "How many items were on the test." "What kinds of arithmetic problems (e.g., addition of integers, multiplication of fractions, story problems) were presented?" "How difficult was the test?" "How does a score of 35 compare with the scores received by other students in Michael's class?"

Answers to these or similar questions are needed to make any raw score meaningful. We can provide meaning to a raw score by converting it into a description of the specific tasks that the student can perform (criterion-referenced interpretation) or comparison of that performance to specified performance standards (e.g., if the proficient performance standard corresponded to a raw score of 34 and the advanced performance standard corresponded to a raw score of 40, then Michael's 35 would be called proficient). Alternatively, we can provide meaning by converting a raw score into some type of derived score that indicates the student's relative position in a clearly defined reference group (norm-referenced interpretation). Questions such as the one about the specific kind of mathematics problems that are on the test are directed at a desire for criterion-referenced and standards-based interpretations, while those such as the one asking for a comparison with the performance of other students are directed at the desire for norm-referenced interpretations. Often both types of interpretation are appropriate and useful.

##### Criterion-Referenced and Standards-Based Interpretations

Criterion-referenced test interpretation permits us to describe an individual's test performance without referring to the performance of others. Thus, we might describe student performance in terms of the speed with which a task is performed (e.g., types 40 words per minute without error), the precision with which a task is performed (e.g., measures the length of a line within one-sixteenth of an inch), or the percentage of items correct on some clearly defined set of learning tasks (e.g., identifies the meaning of 80% of the terms used to describe fractions). Performance standards specify levels of performance that students are expected to achieve for the performance to be considered "partially proficient," "proficient," or "advanced" and thereby provide a basis for defining the level of performance that is judged to be adequate or exemplary.

The percentage-correct score is widely used in criterion-referenced test interpretation. Standards for judging whether a student has mastered each of the instructional objectives or achievement domains measured by a criterion-referenced test are frequently set in these terms. The key, however, is in providing a clear description of what a student can and cannot do rather than in the use of a percentage-correct score. Knowing, for example, that Michael Adams's raw score of 35 corresponds to a percentage-correct score of 70 because there were 50 items on the mathematics test provides little help in understanding the meaning of the score. We still need to have a clear description of the domain of mathematics items that the test represents in order to make a criterion-referenced interpretation of his score. We may also want to have prespecified performance standards in determining the adequacy of Michael's score.

Criterion-referenced and standards-based interpretations of test results are most meaningful when the test has been specifically designed for this purpose (see Chapter 16). This typically involves designing a test that measures a set of clearly stated learning tasks. Enough items are used for each interpretation to make it possible to deso'ibe test performance in terms of a student's mastelY or norunastelY of the tasks. The value of these descriptions of test performance is enhanced by the fact that the domain of measured achievement is delimited and dearly specified, the test items are selected on the basis of their relevance to the domain being measured, and there are enough test items to make dependable judgments concerning the types of tasks a student can and cannot perform.

Critelion-Referenced Interpretation of Standardized Tests. Although standardized tests are frequently designed for norm-referenced interpretations, it is possible to attach criterion-referenced meaning to the test results. This simply involves analyzing each student's test responses by item content and summarizing the results with descriptive statements (e.g. , Michael solved all the addition problems involving no carrying but solved only two of the five problems requiring carrying). Some test publishers aid this type of interpretation by (a) providing the list of objectives measured by the test, with each item keyed to the appropriate objective, and (b) arranging the items into larger homogeneous content dusters for easy analysis.

Later in this chapter, we describe and illustrate how criterion-referenced interpretations have been added to the norm-referenced interpretations of standardized tests. Because these tests are usually designed for norm-referenced testing, however, the criterion-referenced interpretations must be made with considerable caution (see the "Guidelines" box).

##### Making Criterion-Referenced Interpretations of Standardized Tests

- 1. Axe the achievement domains (objectives or content clusters) homogeneous, delimited, and dearly specified? If not, avoid specific descriptive statements.
- 2. Axe there enollgh items (say 10) for each type of interpretation? If not, make tentative judgments and/or combine items into larger content clusters for interpretation.
- 3. In constnJcting the test, were the easy items omitted to increase discrimination among individuals? If so, remember that the descriptions of what low achievers can do will be severely limited.
- 4. Does the test use selection-type items only? If so, keep in mind that a
proportion of correct answers may be based on guessing (this is especially cnJcial when only a few items are used to measure a specific content domain).

5. Do the test items provide a directly relevant measure of the objectives? If not, base interpretation on what the items actually measured (e.g., "ability to identify misspelled words" rather than "ability to spell"-they are related but are not the same process).

Grouping items in standardized tests by objective and by larger content dusters enhances the instnJctional use of the results, but cliterion-referenced interpretations mllst be made cautiously.

Expectancy Tables. The use of expectancy tables, as discussed in Chapters 4, also falls within the province of criterion-referenced interpretation. The expectancy table makes it possible to interpret raw scores in terms of expected performance on some measure other than the test itself. As illustrated in Chapters 4, the scores on an aptitude test can be used to predict the probability of earning a particular letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) in a course. Similarly, expectancy tables can be used to predict the probability of success in a training program, on a job, or in any other situation of interest. The use of an expectancy table makes it possible to interpret a raw score simply and directly without the aid of test norms.

##### Norm-Referenced Interpretation

Norm-referenced test interpretation tells us how an individual compares with other persons who have taken the same test. The simplest type of comparison, one that is used in classroom testing, is to rank the scores from highest to lowest and to note where an individual's score falls. Noting whether a particular score is third from the top, about average, or one of the lowest scores in class provides a meaningful report to teacher and student alike. If a student's test score is third from the top in a classroom group of 30 students, then it is a high score, whether it represents 90% of the items correct or 60% correct. The fact that a test is relatively easy or difficult for the students does not alter our interpretation of test scores in terms of relative performance. All that is required is a sufficient spread of test scores to provide a reliable ranking.

Derived Scores. Although the simple ranking of raw scores may be useful for reporting the results of a classroom test, it is of limited value beyond the immediate situation because the meaning of a given rank depends on the composition of the group and on the number of group members. To obtain a more general framework for norm-referenced interpretation, raw scores are converted into some type of derived score. A derived score is a numerical report of test performance on a score scale that has well-defined characteristics and yields normative meaning. The most common types of derived scores are grade equivalents, percentile ranks, and standard scores. Grade-equivalent scores, which are sometimes described as an example of a developmental score scale, report test performance in terms of the grade group in which an individual's raw score is just average. Percentile ranks and standard scores indicate the individual's relative standing within some particular group (see Table 19.1). Converting raw scores to derived scores is simple with standardized tests. Frequently, the test publisher performs the conversions before reporting the scores. If not, however, all we need to do is consult the table of norms in the test manual and select the derived score that corresponds to the individual's raw score. Some derived scores are so easily computed that we can also develop local norms if desired.

There are, as we will see, a variety of ways of expressing standard scores (e.g., T-scores, normal-curve equivalent scores, and standard age scores), but they are based on a common logic. They differ only in terms of the numerical values used and whether they are based on a normal distribution. There are also a number of approaches other than grade equivalents (e.g., age equivalents or publisher-specific extended score scales) to the definition of a developmental score scale. However, grade equivalents are by far the most common for educational achievement tests.

| Type of Test Norm    | Name of Derived Score                   | Meaning in Terms of Test Performance                                     |
| Grade norms          | Grade equivalents                       | Grade group in which student's raw score is average                  |
| Percentile norms     | Percentile ranks (or percentile scores) | Percentage of students in the reference group who fall below student's raw score      |
| Standard score norms | Standard scores                         | Distance of student's raw score above or below the mean of the reference group in terms of standard deviation units |

 Table 19.1

##### Most common types of test norms

Norms. Tables of norms in test manuals merely present scores earned by students in clearly defined reference groups. The raw scores and derived scores are presented in parallel columns so that the conversion to derived scores can be easily made. These scores do not represent especially good or desirable performance but, rather, normal or typical performance. They were established at the time the test was standardized by administering the test to representative groups of students for whom the test was constructed. Thus, they indicate the typical performance of students in these standardization groups and nothing more. They should not be viewed as standards or goals to be achieved by other students.

Test norms enable us to answer questions such as the following:

- 1. How does a studenes test performance compare with that of other students?
- 2. How does a student's petformance on one test (or subtest) compare with performance on another test (or subtest)?
- 3. How does a student's perfonnance on one fOIm of a test compare with performance on another fonn of the test administered at an earlier date?

These comparisons of test scores make it possible to predict a student's probable success in various areas, to diagnose strengths and weaknesses, to measure educational growth, and to use the test results for other instructional and guidance purposes. Such functions of test scores would be severely curtailed without the use of the derived scores provided by test norms.

A summary of the most common types of test norms is presented in Table 19.1. To interpret and use test results effectively, we need a good grasp of the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of each of these types of nOnl1S.

#### **GRADE NORMS**

Grade norms have been widely used with standardized achievement tests, especially at the elementalY school level. The grade equivalent that corresponds to a particular raw score identifies the grade level at whidl the typical student obtains that raw score. Grade equivalents are based on the performance of students in the norm group in each of two

or more grades. For example, suppose the mathematics test that Michael Adams took had been administered to fourth- and fifth-grade students in the norm group in October and in May. We would expect that the group who took the test in May of the fifth grade would generally get higher scores than the group who took the test in October of the fourth grade.

As we see in Table 19.2, this expected pattern is obtained. In October of grade 4, 5()O/o of the students have raw scores below the median score of 28, but this value goes up to 35 in May of grade 4, to 37 in October of grade 5, and to 41 in May of grade 5. Thus, Michael would need to have a higher raw score (41) to obtain a grade equivalent of 5.8 (which corresponds to the typical performance of the grade 5 student in May) than he would to obtain a grade equivalent of 4. 1 (the typical performance of the grade 4 student in October). Because Michael's raw score was actually 35, he would receive a gradeequivalent score of 4.8: the grade at which the typical sUldent receives a raw score of 35. As is suggested by this example, grade equivalents are expressed by two numbers: The first indicates the year and the second the month. Grade equivalents for the fifth grade, for example , range from 5.0 to 5.9, or, if the decimal point is omitted, as is the practice for some tests, from 50 to 59. This division of the calendar year into tenths, starting with September = .0 and ending with June = .9, is based. on the traditional school year and assumes little or no growth in achievement test performance during the summer vacation months.

Table 19.2 provides all that is needed to convert Michael's raw score to a grade equivalent because he happened to get a raw score equal to the median of one of the grade norm groups. To obtain grade equivalents for Bob Brown, who got a raw score of 31,and Teresa Chavez who got a raw score of 45, however we would need some more information. We could see that Bob should have a grade equivalent somewhere between 4.1 and 4.8, but to determine a specific score we would need to interpolate (Le., decide how far to go above 4.1 toward 4.8) to account for the fact that Bob did better than the typical fourth-grade student did in October but not as well as the typical fourth-grade sUldent in May. Similarly, we could see that Teresa's raw score of 45 should be converted to a grade-equivalent score above 5.8 but would have to extrapolate (Le., project the rate of increase with grade level beyond the point where data were collected) to give Teresa a specific grade equivalent.

Fortunately, we do not need to know the details of interpolation and extrapolation to convert Bob's and Teresa's raw scores to grade equivalents. Test publishers perform those

**TABLE-Illustration of the construction of grade-equivalent scores**
| Grade | Time of Administration (Month) | Median" Raw Score | Grade Equivalent |
|-------|--------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 4     | October (.1)                   | 28                | 4.1              |
| 4     | May (.8)                       | 35                | 4.8              |
| 5     | October (.1)                   | 37                | 5.1              |
| 5     | May (.8)                       | 41                | 5.8              |

operations and produce tables showing the grade equivalent corresponding to each possible raw score. To convert to grade equivalents with a table of grade norms, all one needs to do is find the students' raw scores in the table and read off the corresponding grade equivalents. Using this procedure, for example , we might find that Bob's grade equivalent is 4.4 and that Teresa's grade equivalent is 6.5. Grade norms are popular largely because test performance is expressed in units that are easy to understand and interpret. To illustrate, assume that we obtained the following grade equivalents for Jennifer, who is in the middle of the fifth grade.

| Mathematics | 5.5 |
|-------------|-----|
| Language    | 6.5 |
| Reading     | 9.0 |

In examining these scores, teachers, parents, and students alike would recognize that Jennifer is exactly average in mathematics, 1 year advanced in language, and ~ years advanced in reading. Grade equivalents provide a common unit with which we all are familiar. The only difficulty is that tllis familiarity leads those who are unaware of the numerous limitations of grade norms to misleading or inaccurate interpretations. Concern about misinterpretations of grade equivalents has led to sharp criticisms of the scores. Indeed, an earlier version of the *Standards* (American Psychological Association, 1974) suggested that the use of grade-equivalent scores should be discouraged. On the other hand, some measurement expelts (Hoover, 1984) have argued that grade equivalents are useful and no more subject to misinterpretation than other types of scores. In any event, nothing indicates their popularity is declining. It is important to understand their limitations

Six possible misinterpretations of grade equivalents are wOlthy of consideration. Each of these misinterpretations is based on an unjustified assumption about the meaning of the scores. These inappropriate assumptions are (1) assuming that norms are standards of what should be, (2) assuming that grade equivalents indicate the appropriate grade placement for a student, (3) assuming that all students should be expected to grow one grade-equivalent unit per year, (4) assuming that the units are equal throughout the score range, (5) assuming that grade equivalents for different tests are comparable, and (6) assuming that the scores that are based on extrapolations to grades well above or below the test level are meaningful. Let's briefly consider each of these faulty assumptions and the reSUlting misinterpretation of grade equivalents.

1. Don't confuse norms with standards of what should be. For any particular grade equivalent, 50% of the students in the standardization group are above this norm, and 50% are below. Consequently, we should not interpret a particular grade norm as something all our students should attain. If half our students are above norm and half are below, we may conclude that our students compare favorably with the students in tl1e norm group. Whether this is good or bad depends on a number of factors, such as our students' ability, the extent to which tl1e learning outcomes measured by the test reflect our curriculum emphasis, and the quality of tl1e educational facilities at our disposal. If we are teaching students with above-average ability under conditions comparable to those of schools in the norm group, merely matching the norm would be cause for concern. On the otl1er hand, if our students have a history of low achievement in previous grades, reaching the nonn might call for considerable pride. In any case, it is well to remember that the norm is merely an average score made by the students in the standardization group. As such, it represents the typical performance of average students in average schools and should not be considered a standard of excellence to be achieved by others.

2. Don't interpret a grade equivalent as an estimate of the grade where a student should be placed. One potential misinterpretation of grade nonns, although not because of weaknesses in the scoring system itself, is to assume that students who earn certain gradeequivalent scores are ready to do work at that level. For example, we might conclude that a fourth-grade SUI dent should be doing sixth-grade work in language skills if she earns a grade equivalent of 6.0 on a language skills test. This assumption overlooks the fact that she can obtain a grade-equivalent score well above her grade level by doing the less difficult test items more rapidly and accurately than the average fourth-grade student. The grade-equivalent score of 6.0 may represent nothing more than a thorough mastery of language skills taught in the first four grades. Thus, grade equivalents should never be interpreted literally; at best, they are only rough guides to the level of test perfonnance. Students at different grade levels who earn the same grade-equivalent score are apt to be ready for quite different types of instmction.

3. Don't expect that all students should gain 1.0 grade equivalent each year. It seems natural to think that if Jane and Sara had grade equivalents of 4.7 and 2.5, respectively, at the end of grade 3, they should be expected to each gain 1.0 and have scores of 5.7 and 3.5 at the end of grade 4. This expectation is inappropriate not only because norms should not be confused with standards but also because a gain of 1.0 per year is typical only of students scoring close to the average for their grade. On average, students who score well above their grade placement gain more than 1.0 grade equivalent per year, whereas students who score well below the nonn gain less than 1.0 per year. Thus, if students in a remedial reading program show an average gain of 1.0 in a year's time, that actually would be better than is typical of students with low initial scores.

4. Don't assume that the lmits are equal at different pa11s of the scale. A year of growth in mathematics aduevement from grade 2.0 to 3.0, for example, nught represent a much greater improvement than an increase from grade 4.0 to 5.0 or grade 8.0 to 9.0. Thus, being advanced or behind in terms of grade units has a different meaning on different parts of the grade scale. Students who eam grade equivalents several grades above their grade placement might be demonstrating either vastly superior achievement or pelfonnance just slightly above average.

5. Don't aSSllme that scores on different tests are comparable. A grade-equivalent score of 8.0 on one test publisher's fifth-grade reading comprehension test may not represent the same degree of superior performance as an 8.0 on another publisher's fifthgrade reading comprehension test. We know that in both cases an 8.0 is well above the average for a fifth grader. However, an 8.0 might be one of the highest possible scores for one publisher's test, whereas the scores provided by the other publisher might go conSiderably higher.

The lack of comparability also applies to a single publisher'S tests in different subjects. Patterns of growth vary from subject to subject, and so our grade-equivalent units stretch and contract at different points on the scale for different subjects. Although it would be tempting to conclude that a fOUlth grader who received a grade equivalent of 7.2 in reading and a grade equivalent of 6.3 in mathematics was better at reading than mathematics, such a conclusion is likely to be inappropriate. In comparison with other fourth-grade students, the two scores may actually represent equally superior performance because the range of grade-equivalent scores for fourth-grade students is generally greater in reading than in mathematics.

6. Don't interpret extreme scores as dependable estimates of students' petiormance level. Grade-equivalent scores that are several years above or below the student's actual grade placement and the grade levels where the test is normally used are based on extrapolation. This results in altifidal units that do not con-espond to the achievement of students in any particular group. Estimating these grade equivalents is frequently necessary because the younger students do not have the needed skills to take the test and because growth in the basic skills tends to level off in the eighth and ninth grades. In interpreting grade equivalents at the extremes, therefore, it is well to keep in mind that they do not represent the actual performance of students at these levels.

In summary, grade norms are based on the average performance of students at various grade levels. They are widely used at the elementary scl1001 level largely because of the ease with which they can be interpreted. As we have seen, however, grade equivalents have a number of limitations that can lead to misinterpretations. In general, grade nonns are most useful for reporting growth in the basic skills during the elementary school period. They are least useful for compaling a student'S perfonnances on different tests. For whatever purpose grade norms are used, however, the inequality of grade units must be considered during interpretation of the resuits.

#### **PERCENTILE RANK**

One of the most widely used and easily understood methods of desclibing test performance is percentile rank. A percentile rank (or percentile score) indicates a student'S relative position in a group in terms of the percentage of students scoring lower. Thus, if we consult a table of nomlS and find that a student's raw score of 29 equals a percentile rank of 70, we know that 70% of the students in the reference group obtained a raw score lower than 29. Stating it another way, this student's perfonnance surpasses that of 70% of the group. Percentile rank is sometimes interpreted as the percentage of individuals receiving scores equal or lower than a given score. The specific interpretation depends on the methods of computation used, but for all practical purposes, the meaning is the same.

One method of presenting percentile norms is shown in Table 19.3. These norms are for the three mathematics subtests of the *Stanford Achievement Test, Eighth Edition.*  Percentile norms for other subtests and for the Mathematics Total score are presented in similar tables. The raw scores for each subtest are listed in the first column, and the corresponding percentile rank is listed in the second column under the subtest heading. Corresponding stanine scores, grade-equivalent scores, and scaled scores are also listed in

Table 19.3

the third, fourth, and fifth columns under each subtest. Grade-equivalent scores have already been discussed, and stanine and scaled scores are deso'ibed later.

A student with raw scores of 20 on the Concepts of Number subtest and 25 on the Mathematics Computation subtest would have percentile ranks of 53 and 47, respectively, on those two subtests. It is not surprising that the higher raw score convens to a lower percentile rank in this example because there are fewer items on the Concepts of Number subtest than on the Mathematics Computation subtest. Note that these two percentile ranks of 53 and 47 for a test administered in the spring of grade 7 convert to grade-equivalent scores slightly above (8. 1) and slightly below (7.6) grade level.

Several points are wOrtll noting about the example in Table 19.3. (a) The conversion of raw scores to percentile scores is specific to each subtest (a raw score of 20 conesponds to a percentile rank of 53 on Concepts of Number but only 33 on Mathematics Computation). (b) The conversion is specific to the particular level and form of the test (see table title, Advanced Level 1, Form J). (c) The conversion is spedfic to a particular grade and time of year (spring of grade 7). Different tables would be needed if another form of the test had been administered or if the test had been administered at another time of year or grade. (d) The percentile ranks are for a particular norm group. In this case, these are the national norms for students tested in the spring of 1988. Different percentile ranks would be obtained for specialized norms (large-city nonns or private schools) or for different norming years. (e) As can be seen in Table 19.3, conversions on the Mathematics Applications subtest depend on whetller the students used a calculator when taking this section of the test. A Mathematics Applications raw score of 25, for example, yields a percentile ranlc of 52 for a student who took the test without a calculator but a percentile rank of only 44 for a student who was tested using a calculator

A desirable feature of percentile norms is that we can interpret a student's pelfonnance in terms of various groups. Most conunonly, performance is reponed in terms of relative standing in the student's own grade or age group. In some instances, however, we are more interested in how a student compares with those who have completed secondyear French, are majoring in home economics, or are enrolled in the college preparatory program. Such comparisons are possible with percentile norms. The interpretations of a palticular score are limited only to tlle types of decisions we want to make and the availability of the appropriate sets of norms.

The wide applicability of percentile norms is not witllout its drawbacks. When interpreting a percentile rank, we must always refer to the norm group on which it is based. A student does not have a percentile rank of 80, but a percentile rank of 80 *in some pa1ticulargroup.* A raw score on a scholastic aptitude test, for example, may be eqUivalent to a percentile rank of 80 in a genera l group of high school seniors, 63 in a group of college-bound seniors, and 25 in a group of college freshmen in a highly selective college. Relative standing varies with the ability of the reference group used for comparison.

A related inconvenience with percentile norms is that numerous sets of norms are usually required. We need a set of n01'ms for each group with which we wish to compare a student. This is not especially troublesome at the elementary school level, where a student's own grade and age mates provide a suitable basis for comparison. At the high Sdl001 level, however, where the curriculum becomes diversified and students pursue different courses, it becomes rather difficult. Here we need sets of norms for students who have completed va lying numbers of courses in each subject area.

The main limitation of percentile norms is that percentile units are not equal on all palts of the scale. A percentile difference of 10 near the middle of the scale (e.g., 45-55) represents a much smaller difference in test perfomlance than the same percentile difference at the ends (e.g. , 85-95) because a large number of students receive scores near the middle, whereas relatively few students have extremely high or low scores. Thus, a student whose raw score is n ear average can surpass another 10% of the group by increasing the raw score just a few points. But a student with a relatively high score will need to inaÂ·ease the raw score by a great many points in order to surpass another 10% simply because there are so few students at that level.

The inequality of units requires spedal caution when using percentile ranks. First, a difference of several percentile points should be given greater weight at the extremes of the distribution than near the middle. **In** fact, small differences near the middle of the distribution generally can be disregarded. Second, percentile ranks should not be averaged arithmetically. The appropriate average when using percentile norms is the 50th percentile. This is the midpoint of the distribution and is called the median, or counting average.

In summalY, percentile norms are widely applicable , easily determined, and readily understood. A percentile rank desaÂ·ibes a student's performance in tenns of the percentage of students in some clearly defined group that earn a lower score. This might be a grade or age group or any other group that provides a meaningful comparison (e.g., college freshmen). More than one set of norms is usually reqUired , and percentile ranks must be interpreted in terms of the norm group on which they are based. The most severe limitation of percentile ranks is that the units are unequal. This can be offset somewhat by careful interpretation, however, because the inequality of units follows a predictable pattern

#### **STANDARD SCORES**

Another method of indicating a student's relative position in a group is by showing how far the raw score is above or below average. This is the approach used with standard scores. Basically, standard scores express test performance in terms of standard deviation units from the mean. The mean (M) is the arithmetical average, which is determined by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. The standard deviation (SO) is a measure of the spread of scores in a group. Because the method of computing the standard deviation is not especially helpful in understanding it, the procedure is not presented here (see Appendix A for computation). The meaning of standard deviation and the standard scores based on it can best be explained in terms of the normal probability curve (also called the normal distribution curve or simply the normal curve).

##### **The Normal Curve and the Standard Deviation Unit**

The normal curve is a symmetrical bell-shaped curve that has many useful mathematical properties. One of the most useful from the viewpoint of test interpretation is that when it is divided into standard deviation units, each portion under the CUlve contains a fixed percentage of cases. This is shown in the idealized normal curve presented in Figure 19.1.

![](_page_481_Figure_1.jpeg)

 Figure 19.1

Normal curve, indicating the approximate percentage of cases falling within each standard deviation interval

(For the moment, disregard the raw scores beneath the figure.) Note that 34% of the cases fall between the mean and + 1 SO, 14% between +1 SO and + 2 SO, and 2% between + 2 SO and + 3 SO. (All percentages have been rounded.) The same proportions, of course, apply to the standard deviation intervals below the mean. Only 0.13% of the cases fall below - 3 SD or above + 3 SO. Thus, for all practical purposes, a normal distribution of scores falls between - 3 and + 3 standard deviations from the mean.

To demonstrate the value of standard deviation units for expressing relative position in a group, raw scores from two different tests have been placed beneath the row of deviations along the baseline of the curve in Figure 19.1. The tests have the following means and standard deviations:

|    | TestA | Test B |
|----|-------|--------|
| M  | 56    | 72     |
| SD | 4     | 6      |

In Figure 19.1, the mean raw scores of both tests have been placed at the zero point on the baseline of dle curve. Thus, they have been arbitralily equated to zero. Notice that + 1 SD is equivalent to 60 (56 + 4) on Test A and 78 (72 + 6) on Test B and that - 1 SO is equivalent to 52 (56 - 4) on Test A and 66 (72 - 6) on Test B. If we convert all the raw scores on the two tests to the standard deviation units in this manner, we can direcdy compare performance on the tests. For example, raw scores of 62 on Test A and 81 on Test B are equal because both are 1.5 standard deviation units above dle mean. When converted to standard deviation units, the raw scores are, of course, no longer needed. A + 2.5 SO on Test A is superior to a + 2.0 SO on Test B regardless of the size of the raw scores from which they were derived. The only restriction for SUdl comparisons is that the conversion to standard deviation units be based on a common group.

The utility of dle standard deviation is dlat it permits us to convert raw scores to a common scale dlat has equal units and that can be readily interpreted in terms of the normal curve. At this point, it should be helpful to review a few of the characteristics that make the normal curve so useful in test interpretation.

Referring to Figure 19.1 again, note that 68% (approximately two thirds) of the cases fall between -1 and +1 standard deviations from the mean. This provides a handy benchmark for interpreting standard scores and the standard error of measurement, as both are based on standard deviation units. The fixed percentages in each interval make it possible to convert standard deviation units to percentile ranks. For example, - 2 SD equals a percentile rank of 2 because 2% of the cases fall below that point. Starting from the left of the figure, each point on the baseline of the curve can be equated to the following percentile ranks.

> -2 SD = 2% -1 SD = 16% (2 + 14) 0 SD = Mean = 50% (16 + 34) +1 SD = 84% (50 + 34) +2 SD = 98% (84 + 14)

This relationship between standard deviation units and percentile ranks enables us to interpret standard scores in simple and familiar terms. When used for this purpose, we must, of course, be able to assume a normal distribution. This is not a serious restriction in using standard score norms, however, because the distribution of scores on which they are based usually closely approximates the normal curve. In many instances, the standard scores are normalized; that is, the distribution of scores is made normal by the process of computing percentiles and converting directly to their standard score equivalents. Although it is generally safe to assume a normal distribution when using standard scores from tables of norms in test manuals, it is usually unwise to make such an assumption for standard scores computed directly from a relatively small number of cases, such as a classroom group.

##### Types of Standard Scores

There are numerous types of standard scores used in testing. Because they all are based on the same principle and are interpreted in somewhat the same manner, only the most common types are discussed here.

Z-Score. The simplest of the standard scores, and the one on which others are based, is the z-score. This score expresses test performance simply and directly as the number of standard deviation units a raw score is above or below the mean. The formula for computing a z-score is CourseSman

$$z\text{-score} = \frac{X - M}{SD}$$

CourseSmart

where

X = any raw score

M = arithmetic mean of raw scores

SD= standard deviation of raw scores

You can quickly become familiar with this formula by applying it to various raw scores in Test A or Test B of Figure 19.1 and then visually checking your answer along the baseline of the curve. For example, z-scores for the raw scores of 58 and 50 on Test A (M = 56, SD = 4) would be computed as follows:

$$\mathbf{z} = \frac{58 - 56}{4} = .5 \text{ and } \mathbf{z} = \frac{50 - 56}{4} = -1.5$$

A z-score is always negative when the raw score is smaller than the mean. Forgetting the negative sign can cause seIious errors in test interpretation. For this reason, z-scores are seldom used directly in test norms but are usually transformed into a standard score system that uses only positive numbers.

T-Score. The term T-score was originally given to a type of normalized score based on a group of unselected 12-year-old children. However, it has come to refer to any set of normally distributed standard scores that has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. T-scores (Linear conversion) can be obtained by multiplying the z-score by 10 and adding the product to 50. Thus,

$$\text{T-score} = 50 + 10 \text{ (z)}$$

This fomlUla will provide T-scores only when the original distribution of raw scores is normal, because with this type of conversion, the distribution of standard scores retains the same shape as the original raw score distribution. Some people call any set of scores deIived from this formula T-scoresj others call them linear T-scores or z-scores to distinguish them from normalized T-scores. Applying this formula to the two z-scores computed earlier (z = .;, z = - 1.5), we would obtain the following results:

$$\text{T} = 50 + 10 \text{ (.5)} = 55 \text{ and } \text{T} = 50 + 10 \text{ (-1.5)} = \text{35}$$

One reason that T-scores are preferred to z-scores for reporting test results is that only positive integers are produced. It seems preferable, for example, to repolt a person's test performance as aT-score of 33 than to repOlt the same perfonnance as a z-score of - 1. 7. The two scores are equivalent, however. Because T-scores always have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10, any T-score is directly interpretable. A T-score of 55, for example, always indicates one half a standard deviation above the mean and so on. Once the concept of T-scores is grasped, interpretation is relatively simple.

Normalized Standard Scores. Normalized T-scores are calculated by (a) converting the distribution of raw scores into percentile ranks, (b) looking up the z-score each percentile rank would have in a nonnal distribution and assigning these z-scores to the corresponding raw scores, and (c) converting the z-scores to T-scores, using the formula presented earlier. The procedure of going from raw score to percentile to the corresponding z-score in a normal distlibution is called an area conversion and yields normalized z-scores, which are then transfonned directly into normalized T-scores. This results in a normally distributed set of standard scores regardless of the shape of the original distribution of raw scores. Normalizing is used by test publishers to remove minor irregularities in the raw score distributions.

Many other nonnalized standard scores are computed in the same way that normalized T-scores are determined, but different values are used for the mean and standard deviation. For example, standard scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 are used with some aptitude tests. Consequently, on these tests a score of 115 means one standard deviation above the mean, the same as a T-score of 60. Standard scores can be assigned any arbitrarily selected mean and standard deviation, and the interpretation will be the same because the basic frame of reference is the standard deviation unit.

Stanines. Stanines (pronounced *stay-nines)* are a simple type of normalized standard score that illustrates the process of normalization. Stanines are single-digit scores ranging from 1 to 9. This system of scores is so named because the distribution of raw scores is divided into nine parts (standard nines). Stanine 5 is precisely in the center of the distribution and includes all cases within one-fourth of a standard deviation on eitl1er side of the mean Table 19.4). In a nonnal distribution, percentile ranks of 40 and 60 conÂ·espond to one-fourth of a standard deviation below and above tl1e mean. Any score with a percentile rank of at least 40 but less than 60 is converted to a stanine score of 5. Thus, raw scores corresponding to percentile ranks between 40 and 59 all convert to stanine scores of 5. The remaining stanines are evenly distributed above and below stanine 5. Each stanine, with the exception of stanines 1 and 9, which cover tl1e tails of the distribution, includes a band of raw scores the width of one half of a standard deviation unit. Thus, for all practical purposes, stanines present test nonns on a 9-point scale of equal units. These standard scores have a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. The conversion from percentile ranks to stanines is straightforward for a nonnal distribution (see Figure 19.2).

The following points summarize me major strengths of stanine scores.

1. The stanine system uses a 9-point scale, in which 9 is high, 1 is low, and 5 is average. Thus, the system is easily explained to students and parents, and they can readily visualize where test performance (e.g. , 7) falls on a scale of 1 to 9.

| 89-95                     | 8            |  |  |

- 2. Stanines are normalized standard scores that make it possible to compare a student's performance on different tests (if based on a common group). Typically, a difference of two stanines represents a significant difference in performance between tests (assuming test reliability is satisfactory). Thus, a student with a stanine of 7 in arithmetic and 5 in spelling is probably demonstrating superior performance in mathematics.
- 3. The stanine system makes it easy to combine diverse types of data (e.g., test scores, ratings, and ranked data) because stanines are computed like percentile ranks but are expressed in standard score form. Thus, the conversion to stanines is simple, and the standard score feature makes it possible to add stanine scores from various measures to obtain a composite score. A simple summing of stanines will give equal weight to each measure in the composite.
- 4. Because the stanine system uses a single-digit score, it is easily recorded and takes up less space than other scores. (It was originally developed to fit into a single column on an IBM card.)

The main limitation of stanine scores is that growth cannot be shown from one year to the next. If a student's progress matches that of the norm group, then the same position in the group will be retained and the same stanine will be assigned. Percentile ranks and other standard scores used to indicate relative position in a particular group share this shortcoming. To determine growth, we need to examine the increase in the raw scores or in developmental scale scores (e.g., grade equivalents).

Stanines are sometimes criticized on the grounds that they are rather crude units because they divide a distribution of scores into only nine patts. On the plus Side, however, these crude units prevent the over interpretation of test scores. Although greater refinement might be desirable for some special purposes (e.g., identifying gifted sUidents), stanines provide satisfactory discrimination for most educational purposes. With a more refined scoring system, there is always the danger that minor, chance differences in scores will be interpreted as significant differences.

NormalÂ·Curve Equivalent. The normal-culve equivalent (NCE) is another normalized standard score that was introduced in order to avoid some of the pitfalls of gradeequivalent scores. Because school districts need NCE scores to fulfill the requirements of some federally supponed compensatory education programs, publishers of the major standardized achievement tests have added this score to their list of score reponing options.

Like T -scores, NCE scores have a mean of 50j however, the standard deviation of NCE scores is 21.06 rather than the 10. This seemingly strange choice for a standard deviation was selected so that NCE scores would range from 1 to 99. As can be seen from the following list of NCE scores and their corresponding percentile ranks in Table 19.5, NCE scores of 1, 50, and 99 are equivalent to percentile ranks of the same numerical values. At other points on the scale, however, NCE scores have different numerical values than the corresponding percentile ranks. Compared to percentile ranks, they are more spread out at the extremes (e.g., an NCE difference of 90 to 99 corresponds to a percentile rank difference of only 97 to 99) and less spread out near the middle (e.g., an NCE difference of 50 to 75 corresponds to a percentile rank difference of 50 to 88).

Standard Age Scores. Another widely used standard score for ability tests is the standard age score (SAS). Here the mean is set at 100 and the standard deviation at 16. Thus, a student with an SAS of 84 has scored one standard deviation below the mean (T-score = 40), and a student with an SAS of 116 has scored one standard deviation above the mean (T-score = 60). Scores on ability tests could just as easily be expressed as T-scores or NCEs. However, in the past these tests reported scores as deviation IQ scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 16 (15 on some tests). The SAS (or similar scales, such as the Cognitive Skills Quotient or School Ability Index) has replaced deviation IQ scores in an attempt to avoid some of the misinterpretations associated with the terms intelligence and IQ.

##### Comparison of Score Systems

 19.5

The equivalence of scores in various standard score systems and their relation to percentiles and the normal curve are presented in Figure 19.2. This figure illustrates the interrelated nature of the various scales for reporting relative position in a normally distributed group. A raw score one standard deviation below the mean, for example, can be expressed as a z-score of -1.0, a percentile rank of 16, a T-score of 40, an NCE score of 29, a deviation IQ of 85, an SAS of 84, or a stanine of 3. Thus, the various scoring systems are merely different ways of saying the same thing, and we can easily convert from one scale to another if we assume a normal distribution and comparable norm groups.

The relationships among the scoring systems shown in Figure 19.2 are especially helpful in understanding a particular standard score scale. Until we fully understand T-scores, for example, it is helpful to convert them, mentally, into percentile ranks. A T-score of 60 becomes meaningful when we note that it is equivalent to a percentile rank of 84. This conversion to percentile ranks, which are more easily understood, is also useful for interpreting standard scores to parents and students.

In summary, standard scores indicate a student's relative position in a group in terms of standard deviation units above or below the mean. In a normal distribution, the various standard score scales and the percentile scale are interrelated, making it possible to convert from one to another. Standard scores have the special advantage of providing

| NCE Score | Corresponding Percentile Rank | Percentile Rank | Corresponding NCE Score |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| gg        | 99                            | 99              | 99                      |
| 90        | 97                            | 90              | 77                      |
| 75        | 88                            | 75              | 64                      |
| 50        | 50                            | 50              | 50                      |
| 25        | 12                            | 25              | 36                      |
| 10        | 3                             | 10              | 23                      |
| 1         | 1                             | 1               | 1                       |

Correspondence between percentile ranks and normal-curve equivalents

roughly equal units. TIlliS, unlike percentiles, 10 standard score points represent approximately the same difference in test perfonnance anywhere along the scale. In addition, standard scores can be averaged mathematically. One drawback of standard scores is that they are not readily understood by students and parents. A more serious limitation is that interpretation is difficult unless the scores are normally distIibuted. This is not a problem in using standard score norms, however, because nonn tables are generally based on normalized standard scores.

One of the best ways to become familiar with the vaIious scoring systems and the relationships among them is to review the c011'esponding scores below a selected point in Figure 19.2.

#### **PROFILES**

One advantage of converting raw scores to derived scores is that a student's performance on different tests can be compared directly. This is usually done by means of a test profile, like the one presented in the top half of Figure 19.3. Such a graphic representation of test data makes it easy to identify a student's relative sU'engths and weaknesses. Most standardized tests have proVisions for plotting test profiles.

The profile shown in tlle top half of Figure 19.3 indicates a desirable trend in profile construction. Instead of plotting test scores as specific points on the scale , test perfonnance is recorded in section D by means of bands that extend one standard error of measurement above and below the student's obtained scores. Recall from our discussion of reliability that there are approximately two chances out of three that a students true score will fall within one standard error of the obtained score. Thus, these confidence bands indicate the ranges of scores within which we can be reasonably certain of finding tlle student's true standings. Plotting them on the profile enables us to take into account the inaccuracy of the test scores when compaIing performance on different tests. Interpreting differences between tests is simple with these score bands. If the bands for two tests overlap, we can aSSllme that performance on the two tests does not differ significantly, and if the bands do not overlap, we can assume that there is probably a real difference in perfonnance. Thus, performance on Verbal Reasoning, Numerical Reasoning, Perceptual Speed and Accuracy, and Language Usage subtests does not differ significantly for the example in Figure 19.3. The performance on the Abstract Reasoning subtest is clearly higher than that on the Mechanical Reasoning or Spatial Relations subtests.

The score bands used with *The Differential Aptitu.de Tests* can be plotted by hand or by computer. The computer-produced profile shown in Figure 19.3 is based on the same-sex percentiles. These are recorded in section C of the form, under the column heading "PR." Also shown, under the column head "S," are the c011'esponding stanine scores. The opposite-sex percentiles and stanines as well as those for the combined group of males and females are listed down the right side of the repOlt to show how the scores compare with the female norms and to total group norms. The difference in male and female percentiles for some tests (e.g. , Mechanical Reasoning and Language Usage) highlights the importance of repotting scores in terms of both male and female norms.

Not all test publishers make provisions for plotting score bands, but more will probably do so in the future. In the meantime, it is possible to plot these bands for any test for which we have a standard error of measurement. All we need to do is detennine the error band in raw score points and refer to the norm table with these figures. For example, if a student has earned a raw score of 74 and the standard error of measurement is 3, then the error band in raw score points will range from 71 to 77. By locating these two numbers in the norm table, we can obtain the corresponding range in percentiles, standard scores, or whatever derived score is being used and plot the results directly on the profile. The use of such bands minimizes the tendency of test profiles to present a misleading picture. Withal![ the bands, we are apt to attIibute significance to differences in test performance that can be accounted for by chance alone.

When profiles are used to compare test performance, it is essential that the norms for all tests be comparable. Many test publishers provide for this by standardizing a battery of achievement tests and a scholastic aptitude test on the same population.

##### **Profile Narrative Reports**

Narrative reports that describe how well the student is achieving are also available from publishers of many tests. As illustrated in Figure 19.3, profile reports are frequently accompanied by a narrative report. The graphiC profile provides a quick view of the student's strengths and weaknesses, and the nan'ative report aids in interpreting the scores and identifying areas in which instructional emphasis is needed.

Narrative repOIts are especially useful in communicating test results to parents. They are ofcourse also helpful to those teachers who have had had little or not training in interpretation and lise of scores from published tests.

#### **SKILL ANALYSIS**

Some test publishers provide profiles that include reports for skill objectives as well as for full subtests. An example of such a report is shown in Figure 19.4. The "Performance on Objectives" scores shown on the bottom of the figure are based on the TerraNova, **It**  presents a comprehensive, detailed description of eacll individual's test results. The norm-referenced scores and profile (using percentile bands) are shown in the top half of the report for the full subtests. Section B in the figure can be tailored to report up to six norm-referenced scores. Section C displays percentile bands. The student's national percentile rank is indicated by the diamond for each subtest, and the bands extend one standard error of measurement on each side of the diamond. The criterion-referenced skill analysis is shown in the bottom half of Figure 19.4 under the heading "Performance on Objectives." Section D repolts performance in terms of the objectives measured by the Ten"aNova, and section E displays an "Objectives Performance Index" (OPO for each objective. Users are told that "an OPI of 75 or higher indicates Mastery, an OPI between 50 and 74 indicates Partial Mastery, and an OPI of 49 or less indicates Non-Mastery" (CTB/ McGraw-Hill, 1997, p. 149).

with that of others, the subtest profile identifies strengths and weaknesses in each general content area, and the objectives performance scores and profile, by detailed objectives, identify strengths and weaknesses in specific skills in each general content area. As noted earlier in this chapter, however, caution is necessary when interpreting performance on content clusters based on a small number of test items. In these instances, the results are best interpreted as clues for further study.

In addition to detailed reports for individuals, many publishers also offer profile and skill analysis by class, school system. By using computer scoring and reporting services, test results can be obtained in almost any form desired.

#### JUDGING THE ADEQUACY OF NORMS

As noted earlier, test norms can be expressed in terms of several different types of derived scores. Regardless of the type of derived score used, the main purpose is to make possible an interpretation of students' test performance in terms of a clearly defined reference group. This should not be just any reference group, however, but one that provides a meaningful basis for comparison.

The adequacy of test norms is a basic consideration during test selection and a factor to be reckoned with during the interpretation of test scores. The following criteria indicate the qualities most desired in norms.

1. Test norms should be relevant. Test norms are based on various types of groups. Some represent a national sample of all students at certain grade or age levels, whereas others are limited to samples from a given region or state. For special purposes, the norms also might be confined to a limited group, such as high school students in independent schools, girls who have completed secretarial training in a commercial high school, or college freshmen in engineering. The variety of groups available for comparison makes it necessary to study the norm sample before using any table of norms. We should ask whether these norms are appropriate for the students being tested and for the decisions to be made with the results. If we merely want to compare our students with a general reference group in order to diagnose strengths and weaknesses in different areas, national norms may be satisfactory. Here our main concern is with the extent to which our students are similar to those in the norm population on such characteristics as scholastic aptitude, educational experience, and cultural background. The more closely our students approximate those in the norm group, the greater will be our certainty that the national norms are a meaningful basis for comparison.

But when we are trying to decide such things as which students should be placed in an accelerated group, who should be encouraged to select the college preparatory curriculum, or whether a particular student should pursue a career in engineering, national norms are much less useful. For such decisions, we need norms for each of the specific groups involved. A student can have an above-average aptitude and achievement when compared with students in general and still fall short of the ability needed to succeed in highly select groups. When decisions involve predictions of future success in a particular area, comparing a student with potential competitors is more meaningful than comparisons with grade or age mates.

2. Test norms sbouJd be representative. Once we are satisfied that a set of test norms is based on a group with which comparisons are desired, it is appropriate to ask whether the norms are truly representative of that group. Ideally, the norms should be based on a random sample of the population they represent. This is extremely difficult and expensive, however, so we must usually settle for something less. At minimum, we should demand that all significant subgroups of the population be adequately represented. For national norms, it is desirable to have a proper proportion of students from such subgroups as boys and girls, geographic regions, rural and urban areas, socioeconomic levels, racial groups, and sd100ls of varying size. The most adequate representation in these areas is obtained when the norm sample dosely approximates the population distribution reported by the United States Census Bureau.

3. Test norms should be up to date. One factor that is commonly neglected in judging the adequacy of norms is whether they are currently applicable. The age of norms became a major issue in the late 1980s, when John Cannell (1988; also Linn, Graue, & Sanders, 1990) reported that all states and most school districts where nonn-referenced tests were used were reporting scores above the national average in the elementary grades. This result came to be known as the "Lake Wobegone effect"- a reference to Garrison Keillor's radio program about a fictitious place where all the children are above average. The Lake Wobegone effect led to the charge that the public was being misled and caused a minor scandal in the popular press. One of the major reasons for this effect- though not the only one- was the use of old norms. When ad1ievement is going up, a given raw score will yield a higher percentile rank when compared to old norms than when compared to new norms. With the rapid changes that are taking place in education we can expect test norms to become out of date mush sooner than they did in the past.

It is generally unsafe to use the copyright date on the test manual as an indication of when the nonns were obtained, as this date may be changed whenever the manual is altered, no matter how slightly. To find the year in which the norm groups were tested, consult the desCliption of the procedures used in establishing norms. When a test has been revised, make celtain that the nonns are based on the new edition.

4. Test norms should be comparable. It is often necessary or desirable to directly compare scores from different tests, such as when we make profile comparisons of test results to diagnose a student's strengths and weaknesses or when we compare aptitude and achievement test scores to detect underachievers. Such comparisons can be justified only if the nom1S for the different tests are comparable. We can be assured of comparability when all tests have been normed on the same population. This is routinely done with the tests in an achievement battery~ and test publishers also usually administer a scholastic aptitude test to the same norm group. Whenever tl1e scores from different tests are to be compared directly, the test manuals should be checked to determine whether the norms are based on the same group and, if not, whether tl1ey have been made comparable by other means.

5. Test norms should be adequately desclibed. It is difficult to determine whether these norms provide a meaningful basis of comparison unJess we know something about the nonn group and the nonning procedures used. The type of information we might expect to fmd in a test manual includes (a) method of sampling; (b) number and distribution

of cases in the norm sample; (c) characteristics of the norm group with regard to such factors as age, sex, race, scholastic aptitude, educational level, socioeconomic status, types of schools represented, and geographic location; (d) extent to which standard conditions of administration and motivation were maintained during the testing; and (e) date of the testing (i.e., whether in the spring). Other things being equal, we should always favor the test for which we have detailed descriptions of these and other relevant factors. Such information is needed if we are to judge the appropriateness of test norms for our particular purposes.

#### USING LOCAL NORMS

In some cases, it may be desirable to compare students with local norms. If our students deviate markedly from those in the published norms on such characteristics as scholastic aptitude, educational experience, or cultural background, for example, comparison with a local group may be more meaningful. Local norms can also be useful for making within-class comparisons in special groups (e.g., remedial class in reading) and for determining how well particular children (e.g., handicapped children being mainstreamed) are succeeding in the regular classroom group. When we wish to make profile comparisons of scores obtained from tests standardized on different populations, local norms can also be used to obtain comparable scores by administering all tests to a common local group. Local norms can, of course, also be computed for classroom tests and are especially useful for departmental examinations used in several sections of a course.

Local norms are typically prepared using either percentile ranks or stanines. Most test publishers will provide local norms if requested, but they also can be prepared locally.

#### CAUTIONS IN INTERPRETING TEST SCORES

Interpreting test scores with the aid of norms requires an understanding of the type of derived score used and a willingness to study the characteristics of the norm group. The standards listed in Table 19.6 provide good advice that can increase the likelihood that scores will be interpreted correctly. In addition, keep in mind the following general cautions that apply to the interpretation of any test score.

1. A test score should be interpreted in terms of the specific test from which it was derived. No two scholastic aptitude tests or achievement tests measure exactly the same thing. Achievement tests are especially prone to wide variation, and the differences are seldom reflected in the test title. For example, one mathematics test may be limited to simple computational skills, whereas another may contain a number of reasoning problems. Similarly, one science test may be confined largely to items measuring knowledge of terminology, whereas another with the same title stresses the application of scientific principles. With such variation, it is misleading to interpret a student's test score

> as representing general achievement in any particular area. We need to look beyond test titles and evaluate the student's performance in tenns of what the test actually does measure.

> 2. A test score should be interpreted in light of all of the student's relevant characteristics. Test performance is influenced by the student's aptitudes, educational experiences, cultural background, emotional adjustment, health, and the like. Consequently, when a student performs poorly on a test, first consider factors such as language background, prior educational experiences, improper motivation, or similar factors that might have interfered with the student's response to the test.

> 3. A test score should be interpreted according to tbe type of dedsion to be made. The meaningfulness of a test score is determined to a considerable extent by the use to be made of it. For example, a Scholastic Aptitude stanine score of 4 on the *DA'JT*M would have quite different meaning if we were wanting to predict achievement in the senior year of high school than if we were counseling a student about submitting an application to a highly selective college. We will find test scores much more useful when we stop considering them as high or low in general and begin evaluating their significance in relation to the decision to be made.

> 4. A test score should be interpreted as a band of scores rather than as a specific value. EvelY test score is subject to error that must be allowed for during test interpretation. One of the best means of doing this is to consider a student's test performance as a band of scores one standard error of measurement above and below the obtained score. For example, if a student earns a score of 56 and the standard en"Or is 3, the test performance should be interpreted as a band ranging from score 53 to score 59. Such bands were illustrated in the profIles presented earlier. Even when they are not plotted, however, we should make allowances for these error bands surrounding each score. This will prevent us from making interpretations that are more predse than the test results warrant. Treating small chance differences between test scores as though they were significant can lead to erroneous dedsions.

> 5. A test score should be verified by supplementary evidence. When interpreting test scores, it is impossible to determine fully the extent to which the basic assumptions of testing have been met (i.e., maximum motivation, equal educational opportunity, and

so on) or to which the conditions of testing have been precisely controlled (Le. , administration, scoring, and so on). Consequently, in addition to the predictable error of measurement, which can be taken into account with standard etTOr bands, a test score may contain an indeterminate amount of error caused by unmet assumptions or uncontrolled conditions. Our only protection against such errors is not to rely completely on a single test score. AB Cronbach (1970) pointed out,

The most helpful single principle in all testing is that test scores are data on which to base funher study. They must be coordinated with background facts, and they must be verified by constant comparison with other available data. (p. 381)

The misinterpretation and misuse of test scores would be substantially reduced if this simple principle were more widely recognized. But this caution should not be restricted to test scores; it is merely a specific application of the more general rule that no important educational decision should ever be based on one limited sample of performance.

#### **SUMMARY**

Test interpretation is complicated because the raw scores obtained for a test lack a true zero point (point where there is no achievement at all) and equal units (such as feet, pounds, and minutes). In an attempt to compensate for these missing properties and to make test scores more readily interpretable, various methods of expressing test scores have been deVised. In general, we can give meaning to a raw score either by convening it intn <I nporrintinn nf thp onprifir t<l<k-" th<lt thp "hlnpnt r <l n nprfnrn1 (rritprinn~rpfprpnrprl â¢â¢ ~n ~ ~ ~~ <sup>~</sup>.. t'~~ .. ~ â¢â¢â¢â¢ ~ ut'~~~.~ .~u.~ ... ~ .... ~ u ... ~~ ... ~ .. t'~ .. ~ .... ~ .. ~ .. ~ ... ~.~.~ â¢â¢ ~~~. interpretation) or by converting it into some type of derived score that indicates the student's relative position in a clearly defined reference group (norm-referenced interpretation). In some cases, both types of interpretation can be made.

Criterion-referenced test interpretation permits us to describe an individual's test performance without refeITing to the performance of others. This is typically done in terms of some universally understood measure of profiCiency (e.g., speed or precision) or the percentage of items COtTect in some clearly defined domain of learning tasks. The percentage-correct score is widely used in criterion-referenced test interpretation, but it is primarily useful in mastelY testing where a clearly defined and delimited domain of learning tasks can be most readily obtained. Although criterion-referenced interpretation is frequently possible with standardized tests, such interpretations must be made with caution because these tests were typically designed to discriminate among individuals rather than describe the specific tasks they can perform. Test publishers are attempting to produce tests that are more amenable to criterion-referenced interpretation.

Expectancy tables also provide a type of criterion-referenced interpretation. Instead of describing an individual's performance on the test tasks, it indicates expected performance in some situation beyond the test (e.g. , sllccess in college). Expectancy tables provide a simple and direct means of interpreting test results without the aid of test norms.

Standards-based score reports convert scores into a few broad categories of performance. For example, scores below a specified level may be called below basic, those from that level to another specified level basic, and those above that level proficient or advanced.

Standardized tests typically have been designed for norm-referenced interpretation, which involves convelting the raw scores to derived scores by means of tables of norms. These derived scores indicate a student's relative position in a particular reference group. They have the advantage of providing more uniform meaning from one test to another and from one situation to another than faw SCOfes.

Test norms merely repfesent the typical pelformance of students in the reference groups on which the test was standafdized and consequently should not be viewed as desired goals or standafds. The most common types of norms are grade norms, pefcentile norms, and standard score norms. Each type has its own characteristics, advantages, and limitations tllat must be taken into account dUling test interpretation.

Grade nonns describe test perfonnance in terms of the palticular grade group in which a student's raw SCOfe is just average. These nOtn15 are widely used at the elementalY school level largely because of tl1e ease witll which tlley can be interpreted. Depicting test perfOlmance in tenns of grade equivalents can often lead to unsound decisions, however, because of tlle inequality of the units and the invalid assumptions on which they afe based. Grade-equivalent scores must be interpreted with caution.

Percentile norms and standard score norms describe test performance in terms of the student's relative standing in some meaningful group (e.g. , grade or age group). A percentile rank indicates the pefcentage of students falling below a particular raw score. Percentile units are unequal, but the scores are readily understood by persons without special training. A standard score indicates tl1e number of standafd deviation units a raw score falls above or below the group mean. It has the advantage of proViding equal units that can be treated mathematically, but persons untrained in statistics find it difficult to interpret such scores. Some of the common types of standard scores are z-scores, stanines, T-scores, NeE SCOfes, and standard age scores.

With a nOfmal distfibution of scores, we can feadily convert between standard scores and percentiles, using the special advantages of each. Standard scores can be used to draw on the benefits of equal units, and we can convert to percentile equivalents when interpreting test performance to students, parents, and tll0se who lack statistical training.

A student'S performance on sevefal tests that have comparable norms may be presented in the fonn of a profile, making it possible to readily identify areas of strength and weakness. Profile intefpretation is apt to be more accurate when standard error bands are plotted on the profile. Some test profiles also include narrative reports and/ or detailed analysis of the results by content or skill clusters. This criterion-referenced analysis is especially useful for the instmctional use of test results.

The adequacy of test norms can be judged by determining tl1e extent to which tlley are (a) relevant, (b) representative, Cc) up to date, Cd) comparable, and Ce) adequately described. In some instances, it is more appropriate to use local norms than published nor1115. When local norms are desired, percentile and stanine norms can be easily computed.

In addition to a knowledge of delived scores and n01'1115, the proper interpretation of test scores requires an awareness of (a) what tlle test measures, Cb) the student's characteristics and background, Cc) tlle type of decision to be made, Cd) the amount of error in the score, and (e) the extent to which tlle score agrees with othef available data. No important educational decision should ever be based on test scores alone.

## APPENDIX A **ELEMENTARY STATISTICS**

S tatistics is concerned with the organization, analysis, and intell)retation of test scores and other numerical data. At minimum, teachers should know those statistical techniques that enable them to (a) analyze and describe the results of measurement obtained in their own classrooms, (b) understand the statistics used in test manuals and research reports, and (c) interpret the various types of derived scores used in testing.

Many teachers shy away from statistics because they think it requires advanced mathematics and tedious calculations. However, the elementary statistical concepts and skills we shall deal with require neither. TI1e calculations that can be quite tedious if conducted by hand can be done quite readily with a simple, inexpensive, handheld calculator. Calculators costing \$20 or so not only can do all the intermediate calculations but often have built-in procedures for all of the statistics we shall discuss. Computation of the statistics we consider as well as much more complicated ones obviously can also be readily perfonned on a personal computer with easy-to-use statistical software or spreadsheet software. Hence, we have reduced the emphasis on calculation that was present in previous editions. We also have kept the mathematics to a minimum and will emphasize intelpretation.

The statistics that we shall be concerned with here are known as descriptive statistics. As the term suggests, the emphasis is on describing a set of scores. The description may take the fonn of tables, graphs, or a single number (e,g., an average). Some of these modes of description are seen routinely in newspapers, magazines, and the evening television news. The purpose of these statistics is to summarize sets of numbers so that interesting features may be seen and understood more easily. For example, given a list of the high and low temperatures for eacl1 of the 365 days of a year, it would be possible to read them all and get a sense of how temperate the climate was and of seasonal changes. However, a graph of the average high and low temperatures for each of the 12 months of the year could convey the infonnation much more efficiently and effectively.

We shaH begin with a brief discussion of organizing data and dispiaying resuits in tables and graphs. \Ve shall then turn to a discussion of tl1ree types of statistical measures:

- **1.** Measures of central tendency (averages)
- 2. Measures of variability (spread of scores)
- 3. Measures of relationship (correlation and regression)

The first two measures provide a convenient means of analyzing and describing a single set of test scores, and the third category of measures can be used to indicate the

agreement between two *sets* of test scores obtained for the same students. All tlu'ee are widely used in educational measurement and should be mastered by anyone working with test data.

#### **ORGANIZING AND DISPLAYING SCORES**

When test scores are obtained for a group of students they are usually in haphazard order as shown in Table A.I. After careful inspection of the scores on the midterm exam for the 24 students we see that scores in the 70s and 80s are fairly common, that only three students had scores in the 90s, and that one student had a score less than 50. Similar statements might be made after inspecting the scores on the final exam. We might even note that there is a tendency for the scores on the final to be slightly higher than tl10se on the midterm and that tl1ere is a tendency for students with high scores on the midterm to receive relatively high scores on the final, though the relationship is far from perfect. For example, Student E, who had the highest score on the midterm, had the fourth-highest score on the final, whereas Student W, who had the fifth-highest score on the midterm, had tl1e highest score on the final.

From our detailed inspection of the scores in Table A.I, we could actually get a rough idea of all three of the statistical concepts of concern here. These are the central tendency, or the score obtained by tl1e average student; the variability of the scores (e.g., the midterm scores range from a high of 97 to a low of 45, but most of the students have scores between 60 and 90); and the relationship between performance on the midterm and performance on the final. None of these characteristics of the scores is velY easy to see from the haphazard aITangement of the scores, however, nor are they very precise. If we were working with 200 scores for all seventl1-grade students at a junior high school or 3,000 scores

| Student | Midterm | Final | Student | Midterm | Final |

| A       | 78      | 85    | M       | 65      | 80    |
| B       | 67      | 71    | N       | 92      | 93    |

| D       | 74      | 71    | P       | 65      |       |
| E       | 97      | 91    | Q       | 83      | 76    |

| H       | 65      | 68    | T       | 95      | 80    |

 Table A.1

for all third-grade students in a school district, the difficulty of seeing interesting characteristics and commlmicating them in a precise way would be mud1 greater than it was for our dass of 24 students. But even for our 24 students, we need to organize and display the scores to see these characteristics more easily, and we need to do some simple calculations to quantify the infonnation in a more precise fashion.

##### Simple Ranking

For some uses, it may be sufficient to arrange a set of scores in order of size and to assign a rank to each score. This will indicate the relative position of ead1 score in the group. Ordinarily, the largest score is given a rank of 1, the second largest a rank of 2, and so on until all scores are ranked. The midterm scores from Table A.l have been rearranged in order of size and assigned ranks to illustrate the procedure. The results are presented in Table A.2. Note that when two or more students have the same score (the two 81s, the two 74s, and the three 65s), the average of the ranks for those students is given to each. Thus, the two students who received scores of 81 on the midterm would have been ranked 8 and 9. They are both given the average of these two ranks (8.5) because there is no basis for giving one of the students a rank of 8 and the other one a rank of 9. Using Table A.2 , it is obviously much easier than it was with Table A.I to find the highest and lowest midterm scores and the number of students with scores above 90 or below 70 and to see that scores in the 70s are obtained by students who rank dose to the middle of the dass. It is also easy to see that half the students score above 75 and half of them score below 75. Creating a rank order list for the final exam scores would make it easy to see similar rh~r~rtptÂ·i<;tir<; of tho<;p <;rorps For pY~mnlp it woltlri m~lcp it p~ "ipr to .<;pp th <sup>t</sup>whilp ninp ........ --\_ ....... --. ........ ...................................... .............. .... ............ .. .... . *......................

With only 24 scores, there is no g1Â·eat need to go beyond a rank order display of scores. With more scores, however, it is often helpful to construct g1Â·ouped frequency

distributions and graphs of the score distributions. Grouped frequency distributions of the midterm and final term are shown in Table A.3. Note that the scores haven been grouped into class intervals, the number of scores falling in each intetval has been tallied, and the tallies have been counted to obtain the frequency, or number of scores in each interval. Thus, there were two students with midtenn scores in the interval 95-99, one student with a score in the intetval 90-94, and so on. The total number (M is the sum of the numbers in the frequency column. In the finished table , the tally column is usually omitted as it has been for the final exam scores.

To constnlct a grouped frequency distribution, it is conventional to choose a class interval that is an odd number and that will result in approximately 10 to 12 intervals. TIus makes the midpoint of each interval an integer. For our example, the class interval is 5 (e.g. , 95, 96, 97, 98, and 99 in the highest intetval), and the midpoint of each interval is an integer (e.g., 97 is the midpoint of the highest interval). The lower bound of each interval statts with a multiple of the width of the interval (e.g., the lowest interval starts with 45, the next with 50, and so on). All class intelvals should be the same size.

To decide on the width of the interval that will result in a reasonable number of intelvals, the range can be divided by 12 and the nearest odd number Llsed as the width of the class interval. For example, the highest midtenn score is 97, and the lowest is 45, for a range of 52 (97 - 45 = 52). Since 52/12 = 4.33, the class interval was set at 5, the nearest odd number. Note that applying the same process for the final scores would have suggested using a class interval of 3; however, using the same interval makes it easier to compare the two sets of scores.

The grouped frequency distributions provide a good summary of the results. Features of the two distributions that already have been mentioned can be easily seen, but there is

some loss of information. For example, from the grouped frequency distribution, we see that two students had scores in the intelval 95- 99 on the midterm, but we can no longer tell that one of these students had a 95 and the other one had a score of 97.

##### **Graphic Presentations of Frequency Distributions**

A frequency distribution presents test data in a clear, effective manner, and it is satisfactOly for most classroom purposes. If we want to study the distribution of scores more carefully or to repolt the results to others, however, a graphic representation may be more useful. The two most commonly used graphs are the histogram Cor bar graph) and the frequency polygon Cor line graph). Both graphs are presented in Figure A.I, based on the midterm scores in Table A.3. The scores are shown along the baseline, or hOlizontal axis, and are grouped into the same class intelvals used in Table A.3. The vertical axis, to the left of the graphs, indicates the number of students earning each score and thus corresponds to the frequency column in Table A.3. The histogram presents the data in the form of rectangular columns. The base of eadl column is the width of the class interval, and the height of the column indicates the frequency, or the number of students falling within that intelval. It is as if each student earning a score within a given class interval were standing on the shoulders of the student beneath to form a human column.

The frequency polygon is constructed by plotting a point at the midpoint of eacll class intelVal at a height corresponding to the number of students, or frequency, within that interval and then joining these points with straight lines. As can be seen in Figure A.I, the frequency polygon and histogram are simply different ways of presenting the same data. In actual practice we would use only one of the graphs, the choice being somewhat arbitr lly .

Histograms or frequency polygons allow us to see the shape of the distribution of scores as well as some of the features we have seen before. With a small number of students, such as the 24 in our example, the shape of the distribution is often jagged, going

Figure A.1

Histogram and frequency polygon plotted from midterm exam scores in TableA.3

up and down and up again as you go from left to right. With a large number of scores, however, distributions of scores generally look smoother than the one shown in Figure A.I. Distributions of scores for many students on standardized tests often appear bell shaped, not unlike the shape of a normal distribution, and in many cases normal distribution is assumed or used as an approximation. See Chapter 19 for a description of the nonnal distribution and illustrations of some of its uses.

##### Stem-and-leaf Display

An approach to displaying data that has become increasingly popular in recent years is the stem-and-Ieaf display. like grouped frequency distributions, frequency polygons, and histograms, stem-and-Ieaf displays show the shape of a distribution of scores. In addition, they preserve all the information about the individual scores that is lost when scores are grouped into class intervals.

Tables A.4 and AS show two versions of stem-and-Ieaf displays for the midterm and final exam scores in Table A.I. The "stem" in Table *A.4* is simply the tens digit for each score and the "leaf" is the units digit. On the midterm there were three scores in the *90s*  (92, 95, and 97). These three scores all have a stem of 9, and the individual scores are represented by the string of numbers 257 for the three leaves of 2, 5, 7. Similarly, six students with scores in the 80s (81 , 81 , 83, 84, 85, and 88) are represented by the common stem of 8 and the string of numbers 113458 for the six leaves. The numbers in the columns labeled "count" simply record the number of scores with a given stem. As can be seen, the stem-and-Ieaf displays retain the detail that two students received a score of 81 while giving a general summary of the type provided by a grouped frequency distribution or frequency polygon.

The stem-and-leaf displays in Table A5 show exactly the same information as is shown in Table *A.4.* The stem now corresponds to 5-point intervals, however. Thus, 9Â° represents a stem for the numbers 95 to 99, 9: represents the stem for the numbers 90 to 94, and so on. By using two stems for each tens digit, the shape of the distribution can be seen more easily.

##### Scatter Plots

The graphs and displays we have presented have highlighted all but one of the features that was discussed concerning the data in Table A.I. Because the tables, graphs, and displays have focused on one type of score at a time, they have not done anything to make it easier to see the relationship between scores on the midtenn and the final. To *see* the relationship better than can be seen from a simple listing of the scores, we need to construct a plot that displays pairs of numbers. Such a plot is called a scatter plot (or scattergram). The scatter plot for the scores in Table A.I is shown in Figure A.2. Each dot in Figure A.2 represents a pair of scores for an individual student. TIms, there are 24 dots corresponding to the students. A student's score on the midterm is shown on the horizontal, or X, axis, and the student'S score on the final is shown on the vertical, or Y, axis. For example, Student A had a score of 78 on the midterm and a score of 85 on the final. That student'S score is represented by the dot that is shown by the arrow and the letter A. It is directly above the point on the horizontal line corresponding to a score of 78 and directly to the right of the point on the vertical axis corresponding to the score of 85. Points representing the remaining 23 students are plotted in a similar fashion.

By looking at the plot, we *see* that a swarm of dots tends to run from the lower-Iefthand comer to the upper-right-hand comer of the figure . This shows that there is a positive relationship between the scores on the midterm and the scores on the final. That is, students with relatively low scores on one test tend to have relatively low scores on the other test, whereas students with relatively high scores on one test tend to have relatively high scores on the other test. For example, there are nine dots to the right of 80 on the horizontal axis. These represent the nine students with midterm scores higher than 80. We see that all nine of these points are above 75 on the vertical scale, indicating that no

 Figure A.2

![](_page_508_Figure_3.jpeg)

student who had a score of SO or higher on the midterm had a score of 75 or less on the final. On the other hand, we can see by looking at the lower-left-hand corner of the scatter plot that six of the eight students who had midterm scores of 65 or less had scores of 75 or less on the final.

Although there dearly is a relationship between scores on the two tests, it is also dear that the relationship is far from perfect. That is, a student who has the highest or one of the highest scores on one test is not always ranked as highly on the other test. Indeed, the four students with scores of 90 or higher on the final had scores ranging all the way from 81 to 97 on the midtenn, while one ot the three students who had scores ot 90 or higher on the midtenn received a score of only 80 on the final.

Scatter plots and the graphs considered here can be produced easily with a personal computer. The version of the scatter plot shown in Figure A.3, for example, was produced using Microsoft EXCEL. The scores on the midtenn and final examinations were entered into the spreadsheet as shown in Table A.S. (The spreadsheet entries and statistics in Table A.S are discussed after the basic statistics shown there have been discussed.) The scatter plot was then produced by pointing and clicking with a mouse and specifying that the column of midterm scores would be used as the X axis and the column of final scores would be used as the Y axis for the scatter plot.

#### **MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY**

A measure of centra l tendency is simply an average or typical value in a set of scores. We all are familiar with the arithmetic average obtained by adding all the scores in a set and dividing this sum by the number of scores. In statistics, this type of average is called the mean and is represented by the letter *M* (or X). Two other commonly lIsed measures of central tendency are the median (represented by Mdn or Pso) and the mode. The median is the midpoint of a set of scores, that is, the point on either side of which half the scores occur. The mode (fashion) is the score that occurs most frequently. Because tl1e mean, median, and mode are different types of averages, the word *average* should be avoided when deso'ibing data. Preciseness requires that ilie specific type of average be indicated.

The method of determining each measure of central tendency is described next and is illustrated in Table A.6.

##### **The Mean** *(M* **or X)**

The mean, or arithmetic average, is tl1e most widely used measure of central tendency. Because it is calculated by adding a series of scores and then dividing tl1is sum by the number of scores, the computation can be represented by tl1e following formula.

$$\overline{X} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \times \text{number of years}$$

$$\overline{X} = \frac{\sum X}{N}$$

where

I = the sum of X = any score N = number of scores

Applying this formula to the scores in Table A.6 produces a mean of 73.92 for the midterm and 78.04 for the final. The mean takes into account the value of each score, and so one extremely high or low score could have an appreciable effect on it.

Note: Scores are rank ordered separately for the midterm and the final.

##### **The Median** *(Mdn* **or** Pso)

The median is a counting average. It is detennined by arranging the scores in order of size and counting up to (or down to) the midpoint of the set scores. If the number of scores is even (as in Table A. 6), the median will be halfway between the two middle most scores. When the number of scores is odd, the median is the middle score.

The median is a point that divides a set of scores into equal halves, and thus the same number of scores falls above the median as below the median, regardless of the size of the individual scores. Because it is a counting average, an extremely high or low score will not affect its value.

##### **The Mode**

The mode is simply the most frequent or popular score in the set and is determined by inspection. In Table A.6, the mode is 65 for the midterm because the largest number of persons made that score. The mode is the least reliable type of statistical average and is frequently used merely as a preliminaIY estimate of central tendency. A set of scores sometimes has two modes and is called bimodal.

#### **MEASURES OF VARIABILITY**

A set of scores can be more adequately desCIibed if we know how much they spread out above and below the measure of central tendency. For example, we might have two groups of students with a mean test score of 70, but in one group the span of scores is from 60 to 80 and in the other the span is from 50 to 100. These represent quite different spreads of performance. We can identify such differences by numbers that indicate how much scores spread out in a group. These are called measures of variability, or dispersion. The ttu-ee most commonly used measures of variability are the range, the quartile deviation , and the standard deviation.

##### **The Range**

The simplest and crudest measure of variability is the range, calculated by subtracting the lowest score from tlle highest score. In the preceding example, the range of scores in the first group is 20 points and in the second 40 points. The range provides a quick estimate of variability but is undependable because it is based on the position of the two extreme scores. The addition or subtraction of a single score can change the range significantly. In the preceding example, tlle ranges of the two groups would become equal if we added two students to the first group: one witll a score of 50 and another with a score of 100. It is obvious that a more stable measure of variability would be desirable. For our example with the midterm and final exam scores, however, the smaller range for the final (96 - 58 = 38) than for the midterm (range = 97 - 45 = 52) accurately reflects the smaller variability in scores on the final exam tllat we have previously noted and that will be quantified by the other measures of variability.

##### **The Quartile Deviation (Q)**

The quattile deviation is based on the range of the middle 50% of the scores, instead of the range of the entire set. The middle 50% of a set of scores is called the interqualtile range, and the quartile deviation is simply half of this range. The qualtile deviation is also called the semi-interqualtile range.

The middle 50% of the scores is bounded by the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. These points are called quartiles and are indicated by Q3 and Qj, respectively. Quartiles are merely points that divide a set of scores into quarters. The middle quattile, or Q2' is the median.

To compute the quartile deviation, we simply determine the values of Q3 and Ql and apply the following formula .

$$Q = \frac{Q\_3 - Q\_1}{2}$$

We use the same counting procedure to locate Q3 and Ql that we used to find the median. With the scores arranged in order of size, we start from the lowest score and count off 25% of the scores to locate Ql and 75% of the scores to locate Q3' Because we have 24 students in our example, Ql is equal to the score that is higher than that achieved by 6 students (25%) and lower than that achieved by 18 students (75%). For the midterm, Ql = 65, and for the final, Ql = 71.5. Note that Ql is 71.5 on the fmal because it falls halfway between 71, the sixth lowest score, and 72, the seventh lowest score. The values of Q3 are 83.5 for the midtenn (halfway between 83 and 84) and 86 for the fmal (llalfway between 85 and 87).

Given the 75th and 25th percentiles (Ql and Q3), the qualtile deviation (Q) is easily computed. As would be expected from what we have already seen, Q is larger for the midterm scores [Q = (83.5 - 65)/2 = 9.25) than it is for the final scores [Q = (86 - 71.5)/2 <sup>=</sup> 7.25). These quartile deviation values simply quantify the fact that the midterm scores are more variable than the final scores.

Although quartiles are points on the scale (like averages and percentiles), the quartile deviation represents a distance on the scale. It indicates the distance we need to go above and below the median to include approximately the middle 50% of the scores.

##### **The Standard Deviation** *(SD,* **S, or 0')**

The most useful measure of variability, or spread of scores, is the standard deviation. The computation of the standard deviation does not make its meaning readily apparent, but essentially it is an average of the degree to whicll a set of scores deviates from the mean. Because it takes into account the amount that each score deviates from the mean, it is a more stable measure of variability than either the range or quattile deviation.

Because the procedure for calculating a standard deviation involves squaling each score, summing the scores and the squares of the scores, as well as taking a square root, the help of a handheld calculator is highly desirable for any reasonably sized problem. Better yet, a calculator with built -in statistical procedures or a microcomputer with a simple statistical package is recommended for anyone who wants to compute statistics such as standard deviations and correlations on a routine basis. To petfonn the calculations by hand or with a handheld calculator that does not offer statistical procedures, however, the following steps are involved.

- **1.** Find the sum of the scores (kX) as was done [0 compute the mean.
- 2. Square each score *(X2).*
- 3. Find the sum of the squared scores (kX~.
- 4. Square the sum of the scores obtained in Step 1; that is, multiply (kX) times (kX).
- 5. Divide the square obtained in Step 4 by N, the number of students, (kX)(kx)1 N
- 6. Subtract the result in Step 5 from the sum of the squared scores obtained in Step 3, [Ix2 - (kX)(kx)1 N.
- 7. Divide the result in Step 6 by (N 1), one less than the number of students, [IX - (kX)(kX)1 NJ/(N - 1).
- s. Find the square root of the result of Step 7. This number is the standard deviation *(SD)* of the scores.

Thus, the formula for the standard deviation *(SD)* is

$$SD = \sqrt{\frac{\left[\Sigma X^2 - \left(\Sigma X\right)\left(\Sigma X\right)/N\right]}{N-1}}$$

The square of each midterm score and the square of each tlnal score is listed in Table A.7. Also shown are the sums of the scores and of the squared scores. The last column of the table lists the product of the midterm score times the final score for each student. Those numbers are not used for calculating standard deviations but will be used later to calculate the correlation. Using the numbers for the midterm exam in the eight steps just listed, the standard deviation is obtained as follows:

- **1.** From Table A.7, IX = 1,774.
- 2. See Table A.7 for a listing of )(2 for ead1 student.
- 3. From Table A.7, I)(2 = 135,342.
- 4. (kX)(IX) = (1,774)(1 ,774) = 3,147,076.
- 5. (kX)(IX)I N= *3,147,076/ 24* = 131,125.1667.
- 6. [IX2 (IX)(kx)/ NJ = 135,342 131,125.1667 = 4,213.8333.
- 7. [IX2 (IX)(kx)I NJlCn 1) = *4,213.8333/ 23* = 183.210l.

$$\text{8. } SD = \sqrt{\frac{\left[\Sigma X^2 - \left(\Sigma X\right)\left(\Sigma X\right)/N\right]}{N-1}} = \sqrt{183.2101}, = 13.54$$

Applying the same steps to the scores on the final exam, we find that the *SD* for the final is 10.04. What do these standard deviations of 13.54 on the midtenn and 10.04 tell us? First, it should be no surprise that the midterm scores have a larger standard deviation than the final scores. We have already noted that the midterm scores are more spread out. The midterm scores have a larger range and a larger qualtile deviation than the final scores. The larger standard deviation is one more way of quantifying the fact that the midterm scores have greater variability than the final scores do.

The standard deviation, like other measures of variability, represents a c1istance. If we move the c1istance equal to one *SD* above and below the mean, we will find that somewhere between 60% and 75% of the scores faU in that region for most distributions of scores. In a nonnal distribution, 68% of the scores are included between the mean minus one *SD* and the mean plus one *SD.* For example, the midterm had a mean of 73.92 and a standard deviation of 13.54. Thus, the mean minus one *SD* is 73.92 - 13.54 = 60.35,

and the mean plus one *SD* is 73.92 + 13.54 = 87.46. Looking at Table A.7, we see that 16 of the 24 students (67%) have midtenn scores between these two limits. Although the distribution of midterm scores is not the same shape as a normal distribution, the percentage of cases tha t fa ll between the mean plus and minus one *SD* is vety dose to tile 680/0 that would be found for a true normal distribution. This result is not unusual, and it is reasonable to expect that roughly two thirds of the cases w ill have scores between the mean minus one *SD* and the mean plus o ne *SD.* 

Finding the mean and standard deviation is quite easy with a personal computer or a calculator with statistical functions. This is illustrated using a Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet. The student identification letters and their assodated midterm and final scores were entered into an EXCEL spreadsheet, which is shown in Table A.8.

In EXCEL the student column is denoted column A and the midterm and final columns are denoted columns Band C, respectively. The rows are numbered and cells are referred to by column letters and row numbers. Thus, the "Student" label is entered in cell AI, the student designation "A" is entered in cell A2 , and the student designation "X" is entered in cell A25. The midterm scores for the 24 students are in cells B2 through B25, and the final scores are in cells C1 through C25.

The sum of the midterm scores displayed in cell B26 as 1774 was obtained by typing "=SUM(B2:B25)" in the B26 cell. (Note: Only the material between the quotation marks is entered.) Other statistics are obtained by similarly simple statements. For example, the standard deviation for the final scores (shown as 10.041 in cell C32) was obtained by entering "=STDEV(C2:C25)."

##### **Which Measure of Dispersion to Use**

The quanile deviation is used with the median and is satisfactory for analyzing a small number of scores. Because these statistics are obtained by counting and thus are not affected by the value of each score, they are especially useful when one or more scores deviate markedly from the others in the set.

The standard deviation is used with the mean. It is the most reliable measure of variabiiity, and is espedaily usefui in testing. In addition to describing the spread of scores in a group, it serves as a basis for computing standard scores, the standard enol' of measurement, and other statistics used in analyzing and interpreting test scores.

#### **COEFFICIENT OF CORRELATION**

The next statistical measure that we shall consider is the correlation coeffident. The meaning of the correlation coeffident and its use in describing the validity and reliability of test scores can be found in Chapters 4 and 5. Basically, a coefficient of correlation expresses the degree of relationship between two sets of scores by numbers ranging from - 1.00 to + 1.00. A perfect positive correlation is indicated by a coeffident of + 1.00 and a perfect negative correlation by a coefficient of -1.00. A correlation of .00 indicates no relationship between the two sets of scores. Obviously, the larger the coefficient (positive or negative), the higher the degree of relationship expressed.

Recall that from the scatter plot shown in Figure A.2 we concluded that there was a positive relationship between scores on the midterm and scores on the final exam. The relationship was far from perfect, however. Thus, we should expect from an inspection of the scatter plot that the con'elation coefficient should be greater than .00 but less than + 1.00. As we shall see, the correlation between the midterm and final scores is .74. This value reflects a relatively strong but less-than-perfect relationship between these two sets of scores.

Just as there are several measures of central tendency and several measures of variability, there are several different measures of relationship expressed as con'elation coefficients. We shall consider only one of these, the product-moment con'elation coefficient. This is by far the most commonly used and most useful con-elation coefficient. It is the

one that is most likely to be reported in test manuals and researd1 studies. Indeed, if it is not specified othelWise when a correlation coefficient is reported, it is ordinarily assumed to be a product-moment correlation. The product-moment correlation coefficient is indicated by the symbol *rÂ·.* 

As was true of a standard deviation, computation of a product-moment correlation coefficient is best done by a calculator or computer. FOltunately, much of the work for our example of 24 students with scores on a midterm and a final exam has already been done in Table A.7 because many of the intermediate values needed to compute the standard deviations of the two sets of scores are also used to compute the correlation coefficient. The following steps are involved in computing the cotTelation coefficient, rn:

- 1. Begin by writing the pairs of scores to be studied in two columns, as was done in the columns labeled X and Yin Table A.7. Make certain that the pair of scores for each student is in the same row.
- 2. Square each of the entries in the *X* column and enter the result in the *X2* column, as was done to compute a standard deviation.
- 3. Square each of the entries in the *Y* column and enter the result in the *y2* column.
- 4. In each row, multiply the entty in the *X* column by the entlY in the *Y* column and enter the result in the *XY* column (see the right-hand column of Table A 7).
- 5. Sum the entries in each column and note the number *(N)* of pairs of scores. From Table A.7, then,

$$\begin{array}{l} \Sigma X = 1,774\\ \Sigma X^2 = 135,342\\ N = 24\\ \Sigma Y = 1,873\\ \Sigma Y^2 = 148,491.\\ \Sigma XY = 140,772. \end{array}$$

6. Substitute the obtained values in the fOlIDula :

$$r = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\text{Cov}(\text{U})] \cdot \left[\Sigma XY - (\Sigma X)(\Sigma Y)/N\right]}{\sqrt{\left[\Sigma X^2 - (\Sigma X)(\Sigma X)/N\right] \left[\Sigma Y^2 - (\Sigma Y)(\Sigma Y)/N\right]}}$$

This formula looks complex, but it requires only simple arithmetic. For the scores in Table A.7, the most tedious part of the calculations has already been done. All that remains is to substitute numerical values for the appropriate symbols in the previous formula for *r* and do the arithmetic operations. The substiUltions and intermediate steps are illustrated by the following:

The numerator for *r* is

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \left[ \Sigma XY - \Sigma \left( X \right) \left( \Sigma Y \right) / N \right] &=& 140,772 - (1,774)(1,873)/24 \\ &=& 140,772 - 3,322,702/24 \\ &=& 140,772 - 138,445.9167 \\ &=& 2,326.0833 \end{array}$$

The part of the denominator involving X already has been used as part of the calculation of the standard deviation. It is

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \left[ \Sigma X^2 - (\Sigma X)(\Sigma X) / N \right] &= 135,342 - (1,774)(1,774)/24\\ &= 135,342 - 3,147,076/24\\ &= 1135,342 - 131,125.1667\\ &= 4,213.833 \end{array}$$

The part of the denominator involving *Y* is

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \lfloor \sum Y^2 - \{ \sum Y (\sum Y) / N \} &=& 148,491 - (1,873)(1,873)/24 \\ &=& 148,491 - 3,508,129/24 \\ &=& 148,491 - 146,172.0417 \\ &=& 2,318.9583 \end{array}$$

Putting these three parts together in the formula for *r,* we have

$$r = \frac{2.326.0833}{\sqrt{(4,213.8333)(2,318.9583)}}$$
 
$$r = .74$$

Although it is not readily apparent from the preceding formula , the computations involve most of the steps needed to find the mean and the standard deviation of each set of scores eX and Y). Thus, the formula also can be written as

$$r = \left(\frac{\frac{\Sigma XY}{n} - \overline{XY}}{(SD\_{\overline{X}})(SD\_{\overline{Y}})}\right) \left(\frac{N}{N-1}\right)^{\gamma}$$

where

*X* = mean of scores in *X* column

*Y* = mean of scores in *Y* column

SP"C = standard deviation of scores in *X* column

*SDy* = standard deviation of scores in *Y* column

Thus, for the same data,

$$r = \left(\frac{5.865.5 - (73.92)(78.04)}{(13.54)(10.04)}\right)\left(\frac{24}{23}\right)$$
  $r = \sqrt{74}$ 

If the means and standard deviations are alreadv available for the two sets of scores. , . then this latter formula will be easier to apply. If they are not available, the first formula can be used, and the means and standard deviations of the two sets of scores can also be computed during the process, if needed.

As was already stated, it is obviously mud1 easier to compute a correlation with the help of a calculator with statistical functions or with a computer. lhe command to compute the correlation as weJJ as the regression equation is equally simple. The correlation that is shown as .744 in ceJJ E26 of the EXCEL spreadsheet displayed in Table A.8 was obtained by entering "= CORREL(B2:B25,C2:C25)" in cell E26, which tells the spreadsheet to correlate the midtenn scores in cells B2 through *B25* with the corresponding final scores in cells C2 through C25.

#### **LINEAR REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS**

Correlation coefficients provide an indication of the strength of relationship between two sets of scores. In many situations, however, we are interested in using one set of scores to predict the scores that would be obtained on another measure. For example, we might want to predict the grades that students will obtain from their test scores. Or we might want to predict scores on an achievement test from scores obtained on an aptitude test. **In** the example used in this appendix, we can show how linear regression is used to make such predictions.

The linear regreSSion equation for predicting Y (the final) from X (the midterm) is

*y= a+* bX

where *a* and *b* are the regression coefficients. The caret C) over the *Y* indicates that it is the predicted *Y* score rather than the one that is actually achieved. The coefficient *b* is known as the slope, and the coefficient *a* is known as the intercept. They can be computed using the following formulas:

$$b = \frac{r \left(SD\_Y\right)}{SD\_X}.$$

and

*a* = Y - b (X)

where

*r* is the correiation coefficient *SDx* and *SDyare* the standard deviations of *X* and *Y X* and Yare the means of *X* and *Y,* respectively

For the midtenn and final scores, the coefficients are

$$b = \frac{(.7441)(10.0411)}{13.5355} = .5520$$

and

$$a = 78.0417 - (.5520(73.9167) = 37.24$$

Hence, the predicted scores on the final from scores on the midterm are given by the following equation.

$$\mathcal{Y} = \mathfrak{FT}.24 + .\mathfrak{FS2}(X)$$

Using this fonnula for Students A, B, and C, who had midterm scores of 78, 67, and 88, respectively, yields the following predicted scores on the final:

> Student A: *Y=* 37.24 + .552(78) = 80.3 Student B: *Y=* 37.24 + .552(67) = 74.2 Student C: *Y=* 37.24 + .552(88) = 85.8

The aCRlal final exam scores for Students A, B, and Care 85, 71, and 78, respectively. Thus, Student A *did* somewhat better on the final than predicted, whereas Students Band C did somewhat worse than predicted. The difference between the actual *Y* scores and the predicted ones is known as the error of prediction. The errors of prediction get smaller in comparison to the standard deviation of Yas the correlation increases. Thus, the higher the correlation, the more accurate the prediction will be.

Of course, if we already know the scores on Y, there is no need to predict them, other than to see who did better or worse than would have been predicted from previous performance. A more common use of the regression equation for making predictions occurs when the equation that is obtained for one group of students (e.g., the freshman class of 1995) is used to predict the performance of another group (e.g., the applicants for freshman class of 1996). For example, we could use the regression of freshman grades on test scores obtained for the 1995 freshman class to predict the grade that 1996 applicants would obtain if they are admitted.

The regression coefficients are also shown in the EXCEL spreadsheet displayed in Table A.8. The slope, which appears in cell E28, was obtained by entering "=SLOPE(C2:C25, B2:B25)" in that cell, and the intercept was obtained by entering "= INTERCEPT(C2:C25, B2:B25)" in cell E29.

#### A **FINAL CAUTION**

Correlation indicates the degree of relationship between two sets of scores but not causation. If X and Yare related, there are several possible explanations: X may cause Y, Y may cause X, or Xand Ymay be the result of a common cause. For example, the ina'ease in incidence of juvenile delinquency during the past decade has been paralleled by a corresponding increase in teachers' saiaries. Tl1us, the correiation between these two sets of figures would probably be quite high. Obviously, further study is needed to determine the cause of any particular relationship.

## APPENDIX D **STANDARDS FOR TEACHER COMPETENCE IN EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF STUDENTS**

T he professional education associations began working in 1987 to develop standards for teacher competence in student assessment out of concern dlat the potential educational benefits of student assessments be fully realized . The CommitteeÂ· appointed to this project completed its work in 1990 following reviews of earlier drafts by members of the measurement, teaching, and teacher preparation and certification communities. Parallel conU11ittee of affected associations are encouraged to develop sinli1ar statements of qualifications for school administrators. counselor, testing directors, supervisors, and other educators. These statements are intended to guide the preservice and in-service preparation of educators, the accreditation of preparation programs, and the future certification of all educator .

A standard is defined here as a principle generally accepted by the professional associations responSible for this document. Assessment is defined as the process of obtaining information that is used to make educational decisions about students, to give feedback to the student about his or her progress, strengths, and weaknesses, to judge instructional effectiveness and curricular adequacy, and to inform policy. The various assessment techniques include, but are not limited to, formal and informal observation, qualitative analysis of pupil performance and products, paper-and-pencil tests, oral questioning, and analysis of student records. The assessment competencies included here are the knowledge and skills critical to a teacher's role as educator. It is understood that there are many competencies beyond assessment competencies which teachers must possess.

'The Committee that developed this statement was appointed by the collaborating profesSional associations: James R. Sanders (Western Michigan University) chaired the Committee and represented NCME along with John R. Hills (Florida State University) and Anthony J. Nitko (University of Pittsburgh). Jack c. Merwin (University of Minnesota) represented the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, Carolyn Trice represented the American Federation of Teachers, and Marcella Dianda and Jeffrey Schneider represented the National Education Association.

Developed by the American Federation of Teachers, National Council on Measurement in Education, National Education Association.

By establishing standards for teacher competence in student assessment, the associations subscribe to the view that student assessment is an essential part of teaching and that good teaching cannot exist without good student assessment. Training to develop the competencies covered in the standards should be an integral part of preservice preparation. Further, such assessment training should be widely available to practicing teacl1ers through staff development programs at the district and building levels.

The standards are intended for use as:

- a guide for teacher educators as they design and approve programs for teacher preparation,
- a self-assessment guide for teachers in identifying their needs for professional development in student assessment,
- a guide for workshop instructors as they design professional development experiences for inservice teachers,
- an impetus for educational measurement specialists and teacher trainers to conceptualize student assessment, and
- teacher training in student assessment more broadly than has been the case in the past.

The standards should be incorporated into future teacher training and certification programs. Teachers who have not had the preparation these standards imply should have the 0ppo11unity and support to develop these competencies before the standards enter into the evaluation of these teachers.

#### **The Approach Used to Deveiop the Standards**

The members of the associations that supported this work are professional educators involved in tead1ing, teacher education, and student assessment. Members of these associations are concerned about the inadequacy with which teachers are prepared for assessing the educational progress of their students, and thus sought to address this concern effectively. A committee named by the associations first met in September 1987 and affirmed its commitment to defining standards for teacl1er preparation in student assessment. The Committee then undertook a review of the research literaulre to identify needs in student assessment, current levels of teacher training in student assessment, areas of teacher activities requiring competence in using assessments, and current levels of teacher competence in sUldent assessment.

The members of the Committee L1sed their collective experience and expertise to formulate and then revise statements of important assessment competencies. Drafts of these competencies went through several revisions by the Committee before the standards were released for public review. Comments by reviewers from each of the associations were then used to prepare a final statement.

#### **The Scope of a Teacher's Professional Role and Responsibilities for Student Assessment**

There are seven standards in this document. In recognizing the critical need to revitalize classroom assessment, some standards focus on classroom-based competencies. Because of teachers' growing roles in education and policy decisions beyond the classroom, other standards address assessment competencies underlying teacher participation in decisions related to assessment at the school, district, state, and national levels.

The scope of a teacher's professional role and responsibilities for student assessment may be described in terms of the following activities. These activities imply that teachers need competence in student assessment and sufficient time and resources to complete them in a professional manner.

#### Activities Occurring Prior to Instruction

- a. Understanding students' cultural backgrounds, interests, skills, and abilities as they apply across a range of learning domains and/or subject areas;
- b. understanding students' motivations and their interests in specific class content;
- c. clarifying and articulating the performance outcomes expected of pupils; and
- d. planning instruction for individuals or groups of students.

#### Activities Occurring During Instruction

- a. Monitoring pupil progress toward instructional goals;
- b. identifying gains and difficulties pupils are experiencing in learning and performing;
- c. adjusting instruction;
- d. giving contingent, specific, and credible praise and feedback;
- e. motivating students to learn; and
- f. judging the extent of pupil attainment of instructional outcomes.

#### Activities Occurring After the Appropriate Instructional Segment (e.g., lesson, class, semester, grade)

- a. Describing the extent to which each pupil has attained both short- and long-term instructional goals;
- b. communicating strengths and weaknesses based on assessment results to students, and parents or guardians;
- c. recording and reporting assessment results for school-level analysis, evaluation, and decision making;
- d. analyzing assessment information gathered before and during instruction to understand each student's progress to date and to inform future instructional planning;
- e. evaluating the effectiveness of instruction; and
- f. evaluating the effectiveness of the curriculum and materials in use.

#### Activities Associated with a Teacher's Involvement in School Building and School District Decision Making

- a. Serving on a school or district committee examining the school's and district's strengths and weaknesses in the development of its students;
- b. working on the development or selection of assessment methods for school building or school district use;
- c. evaluating school district curriculum; and
- d. other related activities.

#### **Activities Associated with a Teacher's Involvement in a Wider Community of Educators**

- a. Serving on a sta[e committee asked to develop learning goals and associated assessment methods;
- b. participating in reviews of the appropriateness of district, state, or national student goals and assodated assessment methods; and
	- c. interpreting the results of state and national student assessment programs.

Each standard that follows is an expectation for assessment knowledge or skill that a teacher should possess in order to perform well in the five areas just described. As a set, the standards call on teachers to demonstrate skill at selecting, developing, applying, using, conununicating, and evaluating student assessment information and student assessment practices. A brief rationale and illustrative behaviors follow each standard.

The standards represent a conceptual framework or scaffolding from which specific skills can be derived. Work to make these standards operational will be needed even after they have been published. It is also expected that experience in the application of these standards should lead to their improvement and fUI1her development.

#### **Standards for Teacher Competence in Educational Assessment of Students**

**1.** Teachers should be skilled in choosing assessment methods appropriate for insttuctional decisions. Skills in d100sing appropriate, useful, administratively convenient, technically adequate, and fair assessment methods are prerequisite to good use of information to support instructional decisions. Teachers need to be well acquainted with the kinds of information provided by a broad range of assessment alternatives and their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, they should be familiar with criteria for evaluating and selecting assessment methods in light of instructional plans.

Teachers who meet this standard will have the conceptual and application skills that follow. They will be able to use the concepts of assessment error and validity when developing or selecting their approaches to classroom assessment of students. They will understand how valid assessment data can support instructional activities such as providing appropriate feedback to students, diagnosing group and individual learning needs, planning for individualized educational programs, motivating students, and evaluating instructional procedures. They will understand how invalid information can affect instructional decisions about students. They will also be able to use and evaluate assessment options available to them, considering, among other things, the cultural, sociai, economic, and ianguage backgrounds of students. They wiii be aware that different assessment approaches can be incompatible with certain instructional goals and may impact quite differently on their teaching.

Teachers will know, for eadl assessment approach they use, its appropriateness for making decisions about their pupils. ioreover, teachers will know where to find infom1ation about and/or reviews of various assessment methods. Assessment options are diverse and include text- and cuniculum-embedded questions and tests, standardized oÂ·iterionreferenced and norm-referenced tests, oral questioning, spontaneous and struaured performance assessments, portfolios, exhibitions, demonstrations, rating scales, writing

samples, paper-and-pencil tests, seatwork and homework, peer- and self-assessments, student records, obseIVations, questionnaires, interviews, projects, products, and others' opinions.

2. Teachers should be skilled in developing assessment methods appropriate for instructional decisions. While teachers often use published or other external assessment tools, the bulk of the assessment information they use for decision making comes from approaches they create and implement. Indeed, the assessment demands of the classroom go well beyond readily available instruments.

Teachers who meet this standard will have the conceptual and application skills that follow. Teachers will be skilled in planning the collection of information that facilitates the decisions they will make. They will know and follow appropriate principles for developing and using assessment methods in their teaching, avoiding common pitfalls in student assessment. Such techniques may include several of the options listed at the end of the first standard. The teacher will select the tedlOiques which are appropriate to the intent of the teacher's instruction.

Teachers meeting this standard will also be skilled in Llsing student data to analyze the quality of each assessment tecllllique they use. Since most teachers do not have access to assessment specialists, they must be prepared to do these analyses themselves.

3. The teacher should be skilled in administering, scoring, and interpreting the results of both externally produced and teacher-produced assessment methods. It is not enough that teachers are able to select and develop good assessment methods; they must also be able to apply them properly. Teachers should be skilled in administering, scoring, and interpreting results from diverse assessment methods.

Teachers who meet this standard will have the conceptual and application skills that follow. They will be skilled in interpreting informal and fonnal teacher-produced assessment results, including pupils' perfonnances in class and on homework assignments. Teachers will be able to use guides for scoring essay questions and projects, stencils for scoring response-c1lOice questions, and scales for rating perfonnance assessments. They will be able to use these in ways that produce consistent results.

Teachers will be able to administer standardized achievement tests and be able to interpret the commonly reported scores: percentile ranks, percentile band scores, standard scores, and grade eqUivalents. They will have a conceptual understanding of tbe summary indexes commonly reported with assessment results: measures of central tendency, dispersion, relationships, reliability, and errors of measurement.

Teachers will be able to apply these concepts of score and summary indices in ways that enhance their use of the assessments that they develop. They will be able to analyze assessment results to identify pupils' strengths and errors. If they get inconsistent results, they will seek other explanations for the discrepancy or other data to attempt to resolve the uncertainty before arriving at a decision. They will be able to use assessment methods in ways that encourage students' educational development and that do not inappropriately increase students' anxiety levels.

4. Teachers should be skilled in using assessment results when making decisions about individual students, planning teaching, developing curriculum, and school improvement. Assessment results are used to make educational decisions at several levels: in the classroom about students, in the community about a school and a school district, and in society, generally, about the purposes and outcomes of the educational enterprise. Teachers playa vital role

when participating in decision making at each of these levels and must be able to use assessment results effectively.

Teachers who meet this standard will have the conceptual and application skills that follow. They will be able to use accumulated assessment information to organize a sound instructional plan for facilitating students' educational development. When using assessment results to plan and/ or evaluate instruction and curriculum, teachers will interpret the results correctly and avoid common misintelpretations, such as basing decisions on scores t11at lack curriculum validity. They will be informed about the results of local, regional, state, and national assessments and about their appropriate use for pupil, classroom, school, district, state, and national educational improvement.

5. Teachers should be skilled in developing valid pupil grading procedures which use pupil assessments. Grading students is an important part of professional practice for teachers. Grading is defined as indicating both a student's level of performance and a teacher's valuing of that performance. The prindples for using assessments to obtain valid grades are known and teachers should employ them.

Tea.chers who meet this standard will have t11e conceptual and application skills that follow. They will be able to devise, implement, and explain a procedure for developing grades composed of marks from various assignments, projects, in-class activities, quizzes, tests, ancl/or other assessments that they may use. Teachers will understand and be able to alticulate why the grades they assign are rational, justified, and fair, acknowledging that such grades reflect their preferences and judgments. Teachers will be able to recognize and to avoid faulty grading procedures such as using grades as punishment. They will be able to evaluate and to modify their grading procedures in order to improve the vaiidity of the interpretations made from them about students' attainments.

6. Teachers should be skilled in communicating assessment results to students, parents, other lay audiences, and other educators. Teachers must routinely report assessment results to students and to parents or guardians. In addition, they are frequently asked to report or to discuss assessment results with other educators and with diverse lay audiences. If the results are not communicated effectively, they may be misused or not used. To communicate effectively with others on matters of student assessment, teachers must be able to use assessment terminology appropriately and must be able to articulate the meaning, limitations, and implications of assessment results. Furthermore, teachers will sometimes be in a position that will reqUire them to defend their own assessment procedures and their interpretations of them. At other times, teachers may need to help the public to interpret assessment results appropriately.

Teachers who meet this standard will have the conceptual and application skills that follow. Teacl1ers will understand and be able to give appropriate explanations of how the interpretation of student assessments must be moderated by t11e student's socioeconomic, cultural, language, and other background factors. Teachers will be able to explain that assessment results do not imply that such background factors limit a student's ultimate educational development. They will be able to communicate to students and to t11eir parents or guardians how they may assess the student's educational progress. Teachers will understand and be able to explain the importance of taking measurement errors into account when using assessments to make decisions about individual snldents. Teachers will be able to explain the limitations of different infonnal and formal assessment methods. They will be able to explain printed reports of the results of pupil assessments at the classroom, school district, state, and national levels.

7. Teachers should be skilled in recognizing unethical, illegal, and otherwise inappropriate assessment methods and uses of assessment information. Fairness, the rights of all concerned, and professional ethical behavior must undergird all student assessment activities, from the initial planning for and gathering of information to the interpretation, use, and communication of the results. Teachers must be well versed in their own ethical and legal responsibilities in assessment. In addition, they should also attempt to have the inappropriate assessment practices of others discontinued whenever they are encountered. Teacl1ers should also participate with the wider educational community in defining the limits of appropriate professional behavior in assessment.

Teachers who meet this standard will have the conceptual and application skills that follow. They will know those laws and case decisions which affect their classroom, school district, and state assessment practices. Teachers will be aware that various assessment procedures can be misused or overused, resulting in harmful consequences such as emban-assing students, violating a student's right to confidentiality, and inappropriately using students' standardized achievement test scores to measure teaching effectiveness.

## APPENDIX G **TAXONOMY OF EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES**

 Table G.1

Major categories in the cognitive domain of the taxonomy of educational objectives (Bloom, 1956)

#### Descriptions of the Major Categories in the Cognitive Domain

- 1. Knowledge. Knowledge is defined as the remembering of previously learned material. This may involve the recall of a wide range of material, from specific facts to complete theories, but all that is required is the bringing to mind of the appropriate information. Knowledge represents the lowest level of learning outcomes in the cognitive domain.
- 2. Comprehension. Comprehension is defined as the ability to grasp the meaning of material. This may be shown by translating material from one form to another (words or numbers), by interpreting material (explaining or summarizing), and by estimating future trends (predicting consequences or effects). These learning outcomes go one step beyond the simple remembering of material and represent the lowest level of understanding.
- 3. Application. Application refers to the ability to use leamed material in new and concrete situations. This may include the application of such things as rules, methods, concepts, principles, laws, and theories. Learning outcomes in this area require a higher level of understanding than those under comprehension.
- 4. Analysis. Analysis refers to the ability to break down material into its component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood. This may include the identification of the parts, analysis of the relationships between parts, and recognition of the organizational principles involved. Learning outcomes here represent a higher intellectual level than comprehension and application because they require an understanding of both the content and the structural form of the material.
- 5. Synthes is. Synthesis refers to the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. This may involve the production of a unique communication (theme or speech), a plan of operations (research proposal), or a set of abstract relations (scheme for classifying information). Learning outcomes in this area stress creative behaviors, with major emphasis on i~e formulaiion of iJeWpanefns or siruciures.
- 6. Evaluation. Evaluation is concerned with the ability to judge the value of material (statement, novel, poem, research report) for a given purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria. These may be internal criteria (organization) or external criteria (relevance to the purpose) and the student may determine the criteria or be given them. Learning outcomes in this area are highest in the cognitive hierarchy because they contain elements of all of the other categories plus value judgments based on clearly defined criteria.

Major categories in the affective domain of the taxonomy of educational objectives (Krathwohl et aI., 1964)

#### Descriptions of the Major Categories in the Affective Domain

- 1. Receiving. Receiving refers to the student's willingness to attend to particular phenomena or stimuli (classroom activities, textbook, music, etc.). From a teaching standpoint, it is concerned with getting, holding, and directing the student's attention. Learning outcomes in this area range from the simple awareness that a thing exists to selective attention on the part of the learner. Receiving represents the lowest level of learning outcomes in the affective domain.
- 2. Responding. Responding refers to active participation on the part of the student. At this level he not only attends to a particular phenomenon but also reacts to it in some way. Learning outcomes in this area may emphasize acquiescence in responding (reads assigned material), willingness to respond (voluntarily reads beyond assignment), or satisfaction in responding (reads for pleasure or enjoyment). The higher levels of this category include those instructional objectives that are commonly classified under interest; that is, those that stress the seeking out and enjoyment of particular activ~ies.
- 3. Valuing. Valuing is concerned with the worth or value a student attaches to a particular object, phenomenon, or behavior. This ranges in degree from the more simple acceptance of a value (desires to improve group skills) to the more complex level of commitment (assumes responsibility for the effective functioning of the group). Valuing is based on the internalization of a set of specified values, but clues to these values are expressed in the student's overt behavior. Learning outcomes in this area are concerned with behavior that is consistent and stable enough to make the value clearly identifiable. Instructional objectives that are commonly classified under attitudes and appreciation would fall into this category.
- 4. Organization. Organization is concerned with bringing together different values, resolving conflicts between them, and beginning the building of an intemally consistent value system. Thus, the emphasis is on comparing, relating, and synthesizing values. Leaming outcomes may be concerned with the conceptualization of a value (recognizes the responsibility of each individual for improving human relations) or w~h the organization of a value system (develops a vocational plan that satisfies his need for both economic security and social service). Instructional objectives relating to the development of a philosophy of life would fall into this category.
- 5. Characterization by a Value orValue Complex. At this level of the affective domain, the individual has a value system that has controlled his behavior for a sufficiently long time for him to have developed a characteristic lifestyle. Thus, the behavior is pervasive, consistent, and predictable. Learning outcomes at this level cover a broad range of activities, but the major emphasis is on the fact that the behavior is typical or characteristic of the student. Instructional objectives that are concemed with the student's general patterns of adjustment (personal, social, emotional) would be appropriate here.

A classification of educational objectives in the psychomotor domain (Simpson, 1972)

Description of the Major Categories in the Psychomotor Domain

- 1. Perception. The first level is concerned with the use of the sense organs to obtain cues that guide motor activity. This category ranges from sensory stimulation (awareness of a stimulus), through cue selection (selecting task-relevant cues), to translation (relating cue perception to action in a performance).
- 2. Set. Set refers to readiness to take a particular type of action. This category includes mental set (mental readiness to act), physical set (physical readiness to act), and emotional set (willingness to act). Perception of cues serves as an important prerequisite for this level.
- 3. Guided Response. Guided response is concemed with the early stages in learning a complex skill. It includes imitation (repeating an act demonstrated by the instructor) and trial and error (using a multiple-response approach to identify an appropriate response). Adequacy of performance is judged by an instructor or by a suitable set of criteria.
- 4. Mechanism. Mechanism is concerned with performance acts where the learned response has become habitual and the movements can be performed with some confidence and proficiency. Learning outcomes at this level are concerned with performance skills of various types, but the movement patterns are less complex than at the next higher level.
- 5. Complex Overt Response. Complex overt response is concerned with the skillful performance of motor acts that involve complex movement patterns. Proficiency is indicated by a quick, smooth, accurate performance, requiring a minimum of energy. This category includes resolution of uncertainty (performs without hesitation) and automatic performance (movements are made with ease and good muscle control). Learning outcomes at this level inciude highiy coordinaied moior activities.
- 6. Adaptation. Adaptation is concemed with skills that are so well developed that the individual can modify movement patterns to fit special requirements or to meet a problem situation.
- 7. Origination. Origination refers to the creating of new movement patterns to fit a particular situation or specific problem. Learning outcomes at this level emphasize creativity based upon highly developed skills.

## APPENDIX H: RELATING ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES TO INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES

T I nstructional objectives encompass a variety of learning outcomes, and assessment includes a variety of procedures. The key to effective assessment of student learning is to relate the assessment procedures as directly as possible to the intended learning outcomes. This is easiest to accomplish if the general instructional objectives and the specific learning outcomes have been clearly stated in terms of student performance. It is then simply a matter of constructing or selecting assessment instruments that provide the most direct evidence concerning the attainment of the stated outcomes.

The sequence of steps shown in Figure H.1 summarizes the general procedure for relating assessment techniques to instructional objectives.

#### RELATING TEST ITEMS TO INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES

Preparing test items that are directly relevant to the instructional objectives to be measured requires matching the performance measured by the test items to the types of performance specified by the intended outcomes. Stating the outcomes as specifically as possible is useful in this regard, but good judgment is still needed. If the intended learning outcomes call for supplying the answers (e.g., name, define), the test items should also require that the answers be supplied rather than selected. If the intended learning outcomes call for identifying a procedure, the test items should be concerned only with identifying, rather than with more complex outcomes. If the intended learning outcomes call for performing a procedure, the test items should require actual performance rather than a verbal description of how to do it. Issues such as these highlight the care needed in determining whether there is a good match between the stated outcomes and the expected responses to the test items.

Constructing relevant test items was considered in earlier chapters. Here we are simply pointing out the importance of matching test items and assessment tasks as closely as possible to the learning outcomes they are intended to measure. The following examples, from various content areas, show reasonably good matches between intended outcomes and test items. In each example, the specific learning outcome describes the performance the student is to demonstrate, and the test item presents a task that demands that type of performance.

General Instructional Objectives Intended outcomes that direct our teaching. J. Specific Learning Outcomes Types of student performance we are willing to accept as evidence of the attainment of objectives. J. Assessment Tech niques Procedures for obtaining samples of student performance like those described in the specific learning outcomes.

Directions: Read each of the following statements carefully. If you think the statement is a fact, circle the F. If you think the statement is an opinion, circle the o.

- Â® 0 1. George Washington was the first president of the United States.
- F @ 2. Abraham Lincoln was our greatest president.
- O 3. Franklin Roosevelt was the only president elected to that office three times.
- F O 4. Alaska is the biggest state in the United States.
	- (0) 5. Hawaii is the most beautiful state in the United States.

Specific Learning Outcome: Identifies common uses of weather instruments. (Elementary Science)

- 1. Which one of the following instruments is used to determine the speed of the wind?
	- A Wind vane
	- B Anemometer
	- (C) Altimeter
	- D Radar

Specific Learning Outcome: Identifies cause-and-effect relationships. (Elementary Science) Directions: In each of the following statements, both parts of the statement are true. Decide whether the second part explains why the first part is true. If it does, circle Yes. If it does not, circle No.

Examples:

| (Yes) | No | 1. People can see           | because | they have eyes. |
|-------|----|-----------------------------|---------|-----------------|
|       |    | Yes (No) 2. People can walk | because | they have arms. |

In the first example, the second part of the statement explains why "people can see," and so Yes was circled. In the second example, the second part of the statement does not explain why "people can walk," and so No was circled. Read each of the following statements and answer in the same way.

| Yes |    | 1. Some desert snakes are hatched from eggs | Decause | the weather is hot in the desert.      |
|-----|----|---------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|

Directions: The items in this part of the test are to be based on the following resolution :

Resolved: The legal voting age in the United States should be lowered to eighteen. Some of the following statements are arguments for the resolution, some are arguments against it, and some are neither for nor against the resolution . Read each of the following statements and circle

F if it is an argument for the resolution.

A if it is an argument against the resolution.

N if it is neitherfor nor against the resolution.

| Â® | A | N | 1. Most persons are physically, emotionally, and intellectually mature by the age of eighteen. |
|---|---|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| F | A | Â® | 2. Many persons are still in school at the age of eighteen.                                       |
| F | A | Â® | 3. In most states it is legal to drive an automobile by the age of e ighteen.               |
| F | Â® | N | 4. The ability to vote intelligently increases with age.                                          |
| F | A | Â® | 5. The number of eighteen-year-old citizens in the United States is increasing each year.      |

These examples are sufficient to show how test items should be related to specific learning outcomes. Although not all subject-matter areas and all types of learning outcomes are represented, the basic principle is the same. State the desired leaming outcomes in measlU"able terms and select or develop test items that demand that specific type of pelfonnance.

#### **RELATING PERFORMANCE** ASSESSMENT TASKS **TO INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES**

There a re many areas in which testing procedures a re not llseful. In assessing some performance skills (e.g., singing, danCing, or speaking), it is necessary to observe the students as they perform and to judge the effectiveness of the performance. In other instances, it is possible to assess students' skill by judging the quality of the product resulting from the performance (e.g. , a theme, a painting, a typed letter, or a baked cake). In assessing students' social adjustment, it may be necessaty to observe the students in formal and informal situations in order to judge their tendencies toward aggression or Withdrawal, relations with peers, and the like. In fact, w henever we assess how students typically behave in a situation! some type of observatio nal procedure is usually called for.

As with testing procedures, the selection or development of a performance-based assessment task or an observational technique should evolve from the objectives and specific learning outcomes. In the case of rating scales or checklists, the specific learning outcomes become the dimensions to be observed. In the follOWing examples, note how the specific learnin g outcomes require only a slight modification to become items in a rating scale.

More complete rating scales and checklists are presented in Chapter 13. It is our purpose here merely to illustrate how assessment tasks and other observational procedures can be related to the learning outcomes we wish to assess. The specific learning outcomes specify the characteristics to be observed, and the rating scale provides a convenient method of recording our judgments. Such judgments are , of course, still subjective, but we have made them as objective as possible by defining the samples of student responses we wished to observe and then observing those responses.

#### **RELATING ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES USING AN EXPANDED TABLE OF SPECIFICATIONS**

When using multiple techniques to assess classroom learning, it is usually desira ble to expand the table of specifications used in test construction to include both test and nontest procedures. This provides an overall plan that clarifies how each assessment technique relates to the instructional objectives. Including all objectives and assessment procedures in a single table makes clear the relative emphasis given to each objective and each method of assessment and p revents an overemphasis on testing procedures. A simplified version of such a table is presented in Table H.I.
