## Chapter 2: Clear Purpose: Assessment *for* and *of* Learning

*If we can do something with assessment information beyond using it to figure grades, we can improve learning.* 

During the first decade of the twenty-first century, much was written about formative assessment—its impact on achievement, what it is and isn't, how to create formative assessments, how to use formative assessments, and how to use formative assessment teaching strategies in the classroom. In short, formative assessment has garnered the lion's share of assessment attention and established a pretty good name for itself.

Yet the reality is that most assessments in school remain summative—most "count" toward the grade. And, even though they only occur periodically, large-scale accountability assessments continue to dominate our thinking about what is most important.

This chapter begins our focus on the five keys to quality with Key 1: Clear Purpose ( Figure 2.1 ). The questions of how to balance formative and summative assessments, when to use each, and why formative assessment is so important to student learning all trace back to the purpose for the assessment—who is going to use the information and how they intend to use it. This is the crux of Key 1.

### **Chapter 2 Learning Targets**

At the end of this chapter you will know the following:

- How formative and summative assessment fit into a balanced assessment system
- The impact of formative assessment on student achievement
- Major differences between formative and summative assessment

### **A BALANCED ASSESSMENT SYSTEM**

Who uses assessment information? The first answer that may come to mind is "the teacher," followed perhaps by parents, students, administrators, and the public. They all need assessment information to make decisions, but they make different kinds of decisions. No one assessment can fill everyone's information needs; different assessments are required. In a *balanced assessment system,* the key players' formative and summative information needs are identified and assessments are planned to meet their needs. Local district assessment systems serve to promote student success when they serve both formative and summative information needs across all three levels of assessment use: classroom assessment, interim or benchmark assessment, and annual testing (Chappuis, Commodore, & Stiggins, 2010). Figure 2.2 identifies the purposes a balanced assessment system serves. Note in this figure that the different users at each level face different decisions and therefore need different kinds of information to do their jobs of (1) supporting and (2) certifying student learning.

### **IMPACT OF FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT ON ACHIEVEMENT**

Although Figure 2.2 balances information needs among the levels, of particular importance is how assessment information is used. Establishing a balance between formative and summative uses at the classroom and interim/benchmark levels is the most significant contributor to increased student achievement. In traditional classroom practice, most, if not all, of the assessments given have served summative purposes. And at the interim/benchmark level, even those assessments labeled as formative are often used only summatively, leading us to ask formative assessment expert Dylan Wiliam's question: "What's formative about it?"

We know now that formative assessment is reported to cause gains in student achievement, but we have to dig deeper into its many variations to learn what gains to expect and which practices are likely to lead to them. For this information, we look to the research.

The most well-known body of evidence was assembled and summarized by two British researchers, Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam. They conducted a comprehensive review of studies on formative assessment practices that collectively encompassed kindergarteners to college students; represented a range of subject areas, including reading, writing, social studies, mathematics, and science; and were carried out in numerous countries throughout the world, including the United States (Black & Wiliam, 1998a).

The gains they found were among the largest reported for any educational intervention. Typical effect sizes were between 0.4 and 0.7 (Black & Wiliam, 1998b). In some studies they reviewed, certain formative assessment practices increased the achievement of low-performing students to the point of approaching that of highachieving students. To put the standard deviation numbers into perspective, a 0.4 to 0.7 achievement gain translates to 15 to 25 percentile points on commonly used standardized test score scales. For example, a student scoring at the 45th percentile on a standardized test such as the ITBS, who then attained a 0.7 standard deviation gain, would score at the 70th percentile. These are whopping achievement gains—we don't accomplish them with a good night's sleep the night before the test, snacks on the day of the test, or a pep rally. As one might guess, these formative assessment practices were not a matter of ingenious test preparation.

 These are the reported gains that have launched a thousand "formative assessment" products. But the size of the achievement gains is only half of the story. The other half is what occurred to cause the gains. In reviewing the interventions featured in the highest-impact studies, Black and William (1998b) make the following observations:

 • "Opportunities for students to express their understanding should be designed into any piece of teaching, for this will initiate the interaction through which formative assessment aids learning" (p. 143 ).

- "The dialogue between pupils and teachers should be thoughtful, reflective, focused to evoke and explore understanding, and conducted so that all pupils have an opportunity to think and to express their ideas" (p. 144 ).
- "Feedback to any pupil should be about the particular qualities of his or her work, with advice on what he or she can do to improve, and should avoid comparisons to other pupils" (p. 143 ).
- "If formative assessment is to be productive, pupils should be trained in selfassessment so that they can understand the main purposes of their learning and thereby grasp what they need to do to achieve" (p. 143 ).

Therefore, they suggest, the following practices are necessary to achieve the gains promised by formative assessment:

- Use of classroom discussions, classroom tasks, and homework to determine the current state of student learning/understanding, with action taken to improve learning/correct misunderstandings
- Provision of descriptive feedback, with guidance on how to improve, during the learning
- Development of student self- and peer-assessment skills

 Unfortunately, none of these can be purchased as formative items or tests. They are all *practices* , not *instruments* . There is no magic test or tool—we cannot buy our way to achievement-through-assessment nirvana. Fortunately, the practices can all be learned. Even more fortunately, they are not new. Good teaching has included these components all along. However, in our accountability-saturated environment, we may have left more than children behind—we may have also left a few good teaching and assessment practices behind.

 **My Classroom Then and Now 2.1**
**Kristen Gillespie**
I used to . . .
At the end of a class I would ask if there were any questions. I left it up to the individual to raise his or her hand to signal the level of understanding and ask questions.
Now I . . .

Each student is assigned a sticky note with his or her name on it. When prompted, students move their names to one of three boards. One board states that the child is on track and feels comfortable with the information from class. The second board signals to me that the child still has some questions and needs more practice. The third board lets me know that the child needs individual attention to understand the material. Students are asked to move their sticky notes approximately 3–5 times per week.
Why I changed. . .
I noticed that it was simply easier and less embarrassing for the student to not raise his or her hand when asked if anyone needed clarification. I realized that each student had to take more responsibility for his or her own learning. Student self-evaluation is priceless, not only to the student but also the teacher. I wanted to create an environment where students practiced selfmonitoring and made deliberate decisions about their comprehension levels.
What I notice as a result . . .

The students look forward to moving their sticky notes. Those on the first board feel satisfied and proud of themselves. On the other hand, the students on the other two boards get the extra help they need, ultimately leading to a feeling of success.

Over the course of the school year, students realize that placing their sticky notes in the accurate location has rewards. My students are able to selfassess and get additional help thereby avoiding a poor test grade.

#### **Distinguishing Between Formative and Summative Assessment**

To further understand the distinction between formative and summative assessment, we come back to our definitions:

*Formative assessment:* Formal and informal processes teachers and students use to gather evidence for the purpose of improving learning

*Summative assessment:* Assessment information used to provide evidence of student achievement for the purpose of making a judgment about student competence or program effectiveness

When engaged in formative assessment practices, teachers use assessment information during the learning to diagnose student needs, plan next steps in instruction, provide students with targeted practice, and offer effective feedback. Students use assessment information to offer each other effective feedback, to self-assess, and to set goals for improvement. They can also use it to track, reflect on, and share their  progress. When engaged in summative assessment, teachers use assessment information after learning has taken place to determine the level of student achievement at a given point in time in order to determine a student's report card grade from chapter and unit tests, final exams, and term projects, for example. One form of assessment *supports* learning, the other *verifies* it.

We also call formative assessment by another term, *assessment* for *learning.* We do that in part because formative assessment has taken on a number of different meanings and is commonly interpreted as assessing frequently and using the results to plan the next steps in instruction. However, the research on formative assessment includes practices beyond those, as we have seen, so assessment *for* learning is the term we prefer to indicate the collection of practices necessary to realize significant achievement gains.

By the same token, we call summative assessment *assessment* of *learning.* If you prefer the terms "formative" and "summative," feel free to use them. We will use them throughout the book interchangeably with assessment *for* learning and assessment *of* learning. Just remember to include *descriptive feedback to students* and *student involvement in the assessment process* on the formative side. See Figure 2.3 for a summary of key differences.

#### **Why the Distinction Is Important**

Understanding the distinction between assessment *for* learning (formative assessment) and assessment *of* learning (summative assessment) is pivotal to realizing gains in student achievement. The larger gains attributable to formative assessment practices will not materialize unless certain conditions are met:

- **1.** The assessment instrument or event is designed so that it aligns directly with the content standards to be learned.
- **2.** All of the instrument or event's items or tasks match what has been or will be taught.
- **3.** The instrument or event provides information of sufficient detail to pinpoint specific problems, such as misunderstandings, so that teachers can make good decisions about what actions to take, and with whom.
- **4.** The results are available in time to take action with the students who generated them.
- **5.** Teachers and students do indeed take action based on the results. (Chappuis, 2009, p. 6 )

 If one or more of these conditions is missing, the assessment will not cause increased learning, no matter what it is called.

#### **What This Has to Do with Clear Purpose**

Establishing the purpose for an assessment is the first key to assessment quality. To ensure that our assessments and assessment practices are of high quality, we ask three questions at the planning stage:

- **1.** Who is going to use the information?
- **2.** How will they use it?
- **3.** What information, in what detail, do they need?

 Answers to the first question, at the classroom level, as we have seen in Figure 2.2 , are generally *the student, the teacher,* or *the parent* . Answers to the second question follow one of two paths, formative or summative. What are the decisions to be made? Formative—intended to inform instruction (for teacher and student) during the learning? Or summative—used to report about learning that has already occurred?

 The answer to the third question is directly dependent on answers to questions one and two—who needs the information and what they will do with it. As a matter of fact, all assessment design decisions flow from those two initial questions and so we will be revisiting them continuously throughout the book. As soon as we have identified who is going to use the information and what decisions the information will be used to make, we know which path, formative or summative, to take.

**WHAT CLEAR PURPOSE HAS TO DO WITH ACHIEVEMENT.** Let's think about the student for a moment. From a student's point of view, most every assignment is an assessment. Students complete assessments to meet teachers' needs, their district's needs, their state's needs, and their country's needs. How often do they experience assessments that meet *their* needs—not indirectly through the decisions that others make on their behalf, but directly? How long are we going to hammer away at increased achievement through changing teacher actions alone? Until we acknowledge the student's crucial role—if they would only show up/try/do their work—we will continue to change everything but the student. Formative assessment practices work to increase achievement because they change *the student's* interaction with assessment.

### **SEVEN STRATEGIES OF ASSESSMENT** *FOR* **LEARNING**

Effective formative assessment practices all lead to action on the part of the teacher *and the student* that improves learning. As Chappuis (2009, p. 4 ) states, "Well-known educational researchers emphasize this point when they describe what is at the heart of formative assessment:"

Formative assessment, therefore, is essentially feedback (Ramaprasad, 1983) both to the teachers and to the pupil about present understanding and skill development in order to determine the way forward. (Harlen & James, 1997, p. 369 )

[Formative assessment] refers to assessment that is specifically intended to provide feedback on performance to improve and accelerate learning. (Sadler, 1998, p. 77)

Formative assessment is defined as assessment carried out during the instructional process for the purpose of improving teaching or learning . . . What makes formative assessment formative is that it is immediately used to make adjustments so as to form new learning. (Shepard, 2008, p. 281 ) [all items cited in Chappuis, 2009, p. 4 ]

In an often-cited article describing how formative assessment improves achievement, Australian researcher Royce Sadler (1989) concludes that it hinges on developing students' capacity to monitor and adjust the quality of their own work during production:

The indispensable conditions for improvement are that the *student* comes to hold a concept of quality roughly similar to that held by the teacher, is able to monitor continuously the quality of what is being produced *during the act of production itself* , and has a repertoire of alternative moves or strategies from which to draw at any given point. (p. 121 , emphasis in original)

Many teachers offer feedback regularly, as suggested by the research. Many teachers have engaged students in self-assessment and goal setting. These are good ideas that have been a part of effective teaching all along. Yet sometimes these practices work and sometimes they don't. Some students are more willing and able to

take advantage of them than others. One contributing factor to success is how we set up the learning and assessment environment. Another is how we prepare students. Through careful reading of studies on formative assessment as well as on goal orientations (Ames, 1992; Butler & Neuman, 1995; Schunk, 1996; Shepard, 2008), we have organized these research-based recommendations into an instructional framework, the Seven Strategies of Assessment *for* Learning, which builds in the prerequisites to success.

The seven strategies, shown in Figure 2.4 , are structured around three formative assessment questions, drawn from the work of Sadler and others:

- Where am I going?
- Where am I now?
- How can I close the gap?

#### **Where Am I Going?**

##### **STRATEGY 1: PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH A CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE VISION OF THE LEARNING TARGET.** 
Share with your students the learning target(s), objective(s), or goal(s), either at the outset of instruction or before they begin an independent practice activity. Use language students understand, and check to make sure they do understand. Ask, "Why are we doing this activity? What are we learning?"

Convert learning targets into student-friendly language by defining key words in terms students understand. Ask students what they think constitutes quality in a product or performance learning target, then show how their thoughts match with the scoring guide or rubric you will use to define quality. Provide students with scoring guides written so they can understand them. For some learning targets, you can develop scoring criteria with them.

##### **STRATEGY 2: USE EXAMPLES AND MODELS OF STRONG AND WEAK WORK.** 
Use models of strong and weak work—anonymous student work, work from life beyond school, and your own work. Begin with work that demonstrates strengths and weaknesses related to problems students commonly experience, especially the problems that most concern you. Ask students to analyze these samples for quality and then to justify their judgments. Use *only* anonymous work. If you have been engaging students in analyzing examples or models, they will be developing a vision of what the product or performance looks like when it's done well.

 Model creating a product or performance yourself. Show students the true beginnings, the problems you run into, and how you think through decisions along the way. Don't hide the development and revision part, or students will think they are doing it wrong when it is messy for them at the beginning, and they won't know how to work through the rough patches.

 **My Classroom Then and Now 2.2 Jessica Barylski, Audrey Eckert, & Robyn Eidam**
We used to . . .

When concluding a writing lesson, we used to have students conduct a peer review of their work with a partner. We would provide them with checklists and tell them to use these checklists, assuming that they would know what to do. While students were giving each other feedback, we would monitor their conversations. We noticed that students simply read their writing pieces to each other and gave very few suggestions to improve their writing because they believed that was what peer review was.

Now we . . .

We have begun providing strong and weak examples in many of our lessons. To introduce peer review now, we list the criteria for quality peer feedback. Then we show the students a videotape of ourselves modeling weak and strong examples of peer feedback. Including this component adds a visual model to help the students engage. As students watch the clips, they are looking for the criteria that will help them identify the strong example. After thoroughly discussing each video clip, the students apply the peer feedback criteria to their own writing pieces.

Why we changed . . .

Peer feedback was often an area of difficulty for students due to its higher level of thinking. Students never really understood how to participate in the peer review process beyond reading the paragraph and we, as teachers, knew we needed to find a better way to teach them. When we began using formative assessment practices in our classrooms, we became more aware of how using strong and weak examples can impact student learning.

What we notice as a result . . .

First and foremost, the skills the students acquired from this activity were above and beyond our expectations. The students were engaged and focused throughout not only the videos but also during their peer feedback conferences. It was more meaningful for them to see their teachers engaged in a video that was outside of their normal routine. They took ownership of their peer review process, they followed the peer feedback model and criteria, and they took their time and allowed for corrections. They used constructive criticism and their conversations were more meaningful than in the past. We saw growth and improvement in our students' final writing pieces as well.

#### Where Am I Now?

##### **STRATEGY 3: OFFER REGULAR DESCRIPTIVE FEEDBACK.** 
*Effective feedback* can be defined as information provided to students that causes an improvement in learning as a result. In our current system, most of the work students do is graded and often, these grades are the only formal feedback they receive. However, grades do not function as effective feedback. They deliver a coded evaluation without specific information about what students did well or what their next steps in learning might be.

 Researchers and those interpreting their work have examined what causes assessment information to function as effective feedback to students—what kind of feedback will cause the most improvement in student (Ames, 1992; Butler, 1988; Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Shepard, 2001). Their major findings include the following:

 • It isn't enough to be descriptive—a major contributor to effectiveness is *what* is described.

**FIGURE 2.5** Characteristics of Effective Feedback

 **Effective Feedback** 

- **1.** Directs attention to the intended learning, pointing out strengths and offering specific information to guide improvement
- **2.** Occurs during learning, while there is still time to act on it
- **3.** Addresses partial understanding
- **4.** Does not do the thinking for the student
- **5.** Limits corrective information to the amount of advice the student can act on

- Feedback directing attention to the learning leads to greater achievement than feedback directing attention to characteristics of the learner.
- Feedback is most effective when it points out strengths in the work as well as areas needing improvement.

We have translated feedback research findings into five characteristics of effective feedback, shown in Figure 2.5 .

With that in mind, offer descriptive feedback instead of grades on work that is for practice. Descriptive feedback should reflect student strengths and weaknesses with respect to the specific learning target(s) they are trying to hit in a given assignment. Feedback is most effective when it identifies what students are doing right, as well as what they need to work on next. All learners, especially struggling ones, need to know that they did something right, and our job as teachers is to find it and label it for them, before launching into what they need to improve.

Remember that learners don't need to know everything that needs correcting all at once. Narrow your comments to the specific knowledge and skills emphasized in the current assignment and pay attention to how much feedback learners can act on at one time. Don't worry that students will be harmed if you don't point out all of their problems. Identify as many issues as students can successfully act on at one time, independently, and then figure out what to teach next based on the other problems in their work.

Providing students with descriptive feedback is a crucial part of increasing achievement. Feedback helps students answer the question, "Where am I now?" with respect to "Where do I need to be?" You are also modeling the kind of thinking you want students to engage in when they self-assess.

##### **STRATEGY 4: TEACH STUDENTS TO SELF-ASSESS AND SET GOALS.** 
Teaching students to self-assess and set goals for learning is the second half of helping students answer the question, "Where am I now?" Self-assessment is a necessary part of learning, not an add-on that we do if we have the time or the "right" students. Struggling students are the right students, as much as any others. The research described previously tells us it is they who gain the most (cf. White & Frederiksen, 1998).

Self-assessment includes having students do the following:

- Identify their own strengths and areas for improvement. You can ask them to do this before they show their work to you for feedback, giving them prior thoughts of their own to "hang" it on—your feedback will be more meaningful and will make more sense.
- Write in a response log at the end of class, recording key points they have learned and questions they still have.
- Using established criteria, select a work sample for their portfolio that proves a certain level of proficiency, explaining why the piece qualifies.
- Offer descriptive feedback to classmates.
- Use your feedback, feedback from other students, or their own self-assessment to identify what they need to work on and set goals for future learning.

#### **How Can I Close the Gap?**

##### **STRATEGY 5: DESIGN LESSONS TO FOCUS ON ONE LEARNING TARGET OR ASPECT OF QUALITY AT A TIME.**
When assessment information identifies a need, adjust instruction to target that need. This strategy scaffolds learning by narrowing the focus of a lesson to help students master a specific learning goal or to address specific misconceptions or problems. If you are working on a learning target having more than one aspect of quality, build competence one block at a time.

For example, mathematics problem solving requires choosing a workable strategy as one component. A science experiment lab report requires a statement of the hypothesis as one component. Writing requires an introduction as one component. Look at the components of quality and then teach them one part at a time, making sure that students understand that all of the parts ultimately must come together.

 **My Classroom Then and Now 2.3**
**Jeff Overbay** 

I used to . . .

I used a CD-ROM to generate a topic match pre-test. The test would be mostly multiple-choice questions and a few short answer questions. These assessments would be administered at the beginning of the year and before each unit.

Now I . . .

I use the agree–disagree format to design a 10–12 question pre-assessment.

| Example Topic:                                                                  | Agree | Disagree | Depends | Don't Know |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| 1. A Mixture cannot be separated using physical properties.                     |       |          |         |            |
| 2. A Compound is a pure substance composed of two or more elements.             |       |          |         |            |

Why I changed . . .

The old pre-assessments had little value. I could never grade them all in a timely manner and as a result very little data could be gained or used in an effective way. The new agree–disagree format allows me to quickly check the students' prior knowledge about any given topic.

What I notice as a result . . .

This method serves several purposes for the classroom teacher. First, it helps me narrow the focus on where to begin teaching any given unit. Secondly, I could grade the assessment in a timely manner and use the data to drive my instruction. It gives me a starting point. Thirdly, it helps me to decide whether to review quickly or slowly depending on the students' answers to the questions. This *formative assessment* has great value in beginning a new unit of study.

This assessment is not given a score. This allows students to self-assess and takes some of the fear out of "getting a grade." Once they realize that they can be honest without the fear of failure, the information gathered will be more accurate. As a result, the data can be used in an effective way and the stage is set for learning for the individual student.

##### **STRATEGY 6: TEACH STUDENTS FOCUSED REVISION.** 
This is a companion to Strategy 5. After focusing on an area of need, instead of retesting and grading, let students practice it in small segments and offer feedback focused just on that segment. This narrows the volume of feedback students need to act on at a given time and raises their chances of success in doing so, again especially for struggling learners—a time saver for you, and more instructionally powerful for students.

Some ways to help students practice revision include the following:

- Have students work in pairs to critique an anonymous sample and revise it using their own advice.
- Ask students to write a letter to the creator of an anonymous sample they have just critiqued, suggesting how to make it stronger for the aspect of quality discussed.
- Ask students to analyze your own work for quality and make suggestions for improvement. Revise your work using their advice. Ask them to again review it for quality.

 These exercises will prepare students to work on a current product or performance of their own, revising for the aspect of quality being studied. You can then give feedback on just that aspect.

##### **STRATEGY 7: ENGAGE STUDENTS IN SELF-REFLECTION, AND LET THEM KEEP TRACK OF AND SHARE THEIR LEARNING.** 
Engage students in tracking, reflecting on, and communicating about their own progress. Any activity that requires students to reflect on what they are learning and to share their progress both reinforces the learning and helps them develop insights into themselves as learners. These kinds of activities give students the opportunity to notice their own strengths, to see how far they have come, and to feel in control of the conditions of their success. By reflecting on their learning, they deepen their understanding, and will remember it longer. In addition, it is the learner, not the teacher, who is doing the work.

Here are some examples of Strategy 7 activities:

- Students write a process paper, detailing how they solved a problem or created a product or performance. This analysis encourages them to think like professionals in your discipline.
- Students write a letter to their parents about a piece of work, explaining where they are now with it and what they are trying to do next.
- Students track their own progress toward mastery of learning targets.
- Students reflect on their growth. "I have become a better reader this year. I used to . . . , but now I . . . "
- Students help plan and participate in conferences with parents and/or teachers to share their learning.

#### **The Seven Strategies as a Progression**

These seven strategies reflect a progression that unfolds in the classroom over time. Students have trouble engaging in later steps (such as self-assessment) if they have not had experience with earlier steps (understanding learning targets and reliably assessing work). Likewise, it is much harder for students to communicate their progress if the learning targets are not clear, if they are not adept at assessing their work, and if they don't know what they need to do to improve.

Assessment *for* learning can have a powerful impact on student achievement if carried out thoughtfully. It enables students to take control of their own learning by providing a clear vision of the learning targets they are to attain, teaching them to assess where they are with respect to the target, and offering strategies they can use to close the gap between where they are and where they need to be. The research on goal orientations, feedback, and self-assessment comes together to support assessment for learning as the best use of assessment in the service of student learning and well-being.

We give suggestions throughout this book for how to implement each of the seven strategies. For a more in-depth treatment, see Chappuis, 2009.

### **Summary**

In this chapter we have described the characteristics of a balanced assessment system—one that is designed to meet the information needs of all key instructional decision makers. All levels of the system—district, school, and classroom—have a role to play; however, the foundation of a truly effective assessment system is in the classroom—the one level that has shown that it can deliver improved achievement. We reviewed the impact of formative assessment noted by researchers, looking at the achievement gains and the high-impact practices associated with the gains.

We equated formative assessment with assessment *for* learning and summative assessment with assessment *of*  learning. Assessment *for* learning occurs to regularly inform teachers and students about the progress of learning while that learning is taking place. Its purpose is to improve learning while there is still time to act—before the graded event. Assessment *of* learning occurs to sum up achievement at a particular point in time. It occurs after learning has happened.

We drew a clear distinction between assessment *for* and *of* learning to make the point that if we want to attain significant gains through formative assessment practices, certain conditions must be in place. Finally we provided an overview of the Seven Strategies of Assessment *for* Learning, a framework of practices structured to implement assessment *for* learning on a day-to-day basis in the classroom.

Audit Your Assessments for Balance

#### ** Activity 2.3 Conduct a Team Self-evaluation**

This group activity offers you and your team or school staff an opportunity to assess where you are now with respect to key assessment *for* learning practices.

For this activity, you will need the following:

- A copy of the self-evaluation survey for each person
- An open space with the numbers 1 through 5 posted about six feet high on a wall, spaced a few feet apart
- The graphing chart reproduced poster size
- A fat-tip marker
	- **1.** Have everyone individually evaluate their own classroom practice for each of the six statements on the self-evaluation survey, using the 1–5 scale described on the form. Don't put your name on your form.
	- **2.** After all have finished, crumple the surveys into snowball-sized wads, move to an open area, form a circle, and throw them at each other. Throw a few times until you are certain you have an anonymous snowball.
	- **3.** Open up the snowball you have now and become that person. Line up in front of the number on the wall that represents the rating you have on your paper for the rating for the first statement (e.g., if your paper ranks the first statement as a "4," line up in front of the number 4 on the wall).
	- **4.** Ask the person at the head of the line to count the people. Have one person graph the number of people standing in each line on the graphing chart, using a fat-tip marker. Then have that person read the corresponding statement aloud. Do the same for each of the remaining statements.
	- **5.** Debrief by finding partners and commenting on the results you see charted and implications for further learning. Then conduct a large-group discussion of your observations.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|------|---------|
| 1. Students have a clear vision of the learning targets. Targets are communicated to them in language they      |     |      |         |
|    understand (including rubrics). Comments:                                                                    |     |      |         |
| 2. Instruction centers on the learning targets.                                                                 |     |      |         |
