## Chapter 9: Record Keeping: Tracking Student Learning 
 *I'm doomed in this class. All of my mistakes count against me.* 

—Claire, 9th-grade student

I n a class where everything students produce—homework, practice activities, projects, papers, labs, quizzes, and tests—results in a score that contributes to the final grade, all assessments become summative assessments *of* learning, with associated motivational effects, whether or not we have intended them to be. Claire's worry—that nothing is for practice, that all work counts toward the grade—may or may not be an accurate read of the teacher's plan, but it does point to the importance of giving students opportunities to improve before the graded event, a hallmark of effective formative assessment. It also points to the importance of including students in the record-keeping process, to help them notice their growth over time and keep them engaged in trying.

If you have been using assessment information formatively, you may have found yourself rethinking traditional record-keeping practices. You may also have wrestled with the question of what formative assessment information to keep track of. Formative assessment information comes in many forms: it can include practice work and any other evidence of student achievement used diagnostically to inform your instructional decisions, but it can also include assessment information used as feedback to students to inform their own decisions about next steps to take. In addition, students may be using assessment information to self-assess and set goals. All of these activities require access to organized assessment information, some of which it makes sense for the teacher to track and some of which it makes more sense for the student to track.

You may have also noticed that traditional record-keeping practices used for summative information are not always a good fit for the more focused reporting

needs of the standards-based classroom. Many grade reports now are organized by content standard clusters—the old way of recording grades on individual assignments makes it very difficult to fill in the categories. With an outdated record-keeping system, completing standards-based report cards is a lot like fitting a square peg into a round hole.

 In this chapter, we will offer guidelines for tracking both formative and summative information so each can easily be used for its intended purposes, guidelines that lay the foundation for increased student achievement as well as sound grading and reporting practices.

### **Chapter 9 Learning Targets**

At the end of Chapter 9 , you will know how to do the following:

- Separate formative from summative assessment information
- Identify which formative assessment information to track
- Select one or more physical locations for the information
- Set up labels and categories to represent the learning assessed
- Identify what work habits and social skills to track; track them separately from achievement information
- Record achievement information by raw score
- Create a system for students to keep track of their own learning

### **PRELIMINARY DECISIONS**

Tracking formative and summative information involves several preliminary decisions that are at your discretion. Of all of the kinds of evidence that students give you each day, which will be used formatively? Which will be used summatively? Of the formative evidence, what do you need or want to keep track of? Where, physically, will you keep the information? Will students also be involved in tracking their progress? Of the summative evidence, what will figure into the grade? What evidence will be reported separately? Figure 9.2 provides an example of the kinds of information we typically gather, sorted into categories for tracking purposes.

#### **Differentiating Information for Formative or Summative Use**

First, let's review sources of evidence of student achievement. In the "methods" chapters ( Chapters 5 through 8 ), we have discussed how to create and use selected response assessments, written response assessments, performance assessments, and personal communication modes of assessment. Even though these are described as *assessment* methods, their use is not limited to testing. They can be used to generate diagnostic information or to provide practice experiences. They can take the form of questions, discussions, exercises, problems, teaching tasks, quizzes, projects, and performances. So, when we refer to *evidence of student achievement* , we can be referring to information coming from any of these sources, regardless of intended use of the resulting information. In this chapter, we will use the term *assessment events* to describe them all.

When you plan a unit or module of instruction, you will plan for some assessment events that you and/or your students will use *formatively* , during the learning, to decide what comes next in that learning. Recall that this is part of the planning

stage of assessment design described in Chapter 4 . Formative assessment events can look like any of the following:

- Work students do for practice
- Evidence of current status of learning or understanding collected with the intent of grouping students for instruction and/or reteaching
- Work students turn in for feedback from you or from other students
- Evidence students use for self-assessment and goal setting (determining what they have mastered and what they still need to work on)

 You will plan other assessment events to be used *summatively* during or at the end of a unit or module, *after* the learning is to have taken place, to report out level of achievement. This information usually takes the form of a summary number, symbol, phrase, or grade.

 So your first decision in preparing to track student learning is what of the assessment information you gather will be used formatively, and what will be used summatively. For Example 9.1 shows a student tracking form created by 7th-grade language arts teacher Elizabeth Schroeder that clearly divides the formative and summative events for a unit of instruction.

**ALL learning is standards based—** Begin with a goal and then practice, practice, practice until you are proficient. The formative work assigned to you is the "practice" towards the mastery of the standard. It may take a few times before you are ready, but you need to be prepared before testing on your goal. You need to feel confident about what you know! Although you are not given a grade for the practice work, you must correctly complete each assignment before you can take the summative. As each formative is completed, you and I will update this form to track your progress. Please place ALL work behind your tracking sheet in your binder. Work hard! I know you can do this!

 Second, determine what formative assessment information to keep track of. You will be able to use much of the formative information you gather, such as answers to instructional questions or in-class practice exercises, to make the necessary instructional decisions without writing anything down. Other information, such as results from formative quizzes, is useful in monitoring student progress or determining instructional groups for reteaching and therefore it would be helpful to have it as a part of a written record. So your second decision is what types of formative assessment information it makes sense to record.

 Third, begin thinking about what information *students* would benefit from tracking. The more involved students are in keeping track of achievement, the more in touch they are with their own progress, which has positive motivational benefits. "How'm I doing?" ought to be a question they can answer themselves at any point in their learning. On the formative side, it may be more beneficial for them to keep records of feedback, self-assessment, and goal-setting information than it would be for you to track those things separately. When their records are available to you, you still have access to the information. So, as your third decision, consider what formative and summative assessment information it makes sense for students to record.

 **My Classroom Then and Now 9.1**
**Sierra Swanson**
I used to . . .

In past years of my teaching I have always had the day's learning target posted somewhere in my room. I would go over it at the beginning and sometimes the end of my lesson so all students knew exactly what it is we were learning for the day. I didn't put too much emphasis on the targets and I did not really focus much attention on students' understandings of the targets. I would tell everyone what the target was, then continue on with my lesson. I never used the students' understandings of those targets to change the pace of my lesson or the whole unit.

Now I . . .

This year I have been passing out an organized list of the learning targets that each student can use to track their understanding. The list has four columns. The first is the target, then the next three are for the student to rank where they feel about their understanding of that target. We put the date in the boxes so students can see how much they learned over the course of the unit. When the student feels that they have a good understanding of the topic, they can bring their checklist to me and I give them a learning link with a problem for them to demonstrate their understanding. When they get that correct, they can put their name on the link and add it to the class learning chain.

Why I changed . . .

I tried the new method for a couple of reasons. First, I feel that it allows everyone to see where their understanding is of the topics at any time. It can also show them how much they have learned over the unit, by how they have moved columns over time. It helps the students see the pace of the whole unit and keep track of what we have already done, and what we are still planning on doing. Students can also look at their objective list to see what topics they may want to get more help on or practice more before a test or a quiz to help maximize their study time. On top of the benefits for students, it also is a quick and easy way for me to track where students are. We have it on our desks every day so I can walk around and see who feels they have it and which students may need more one on one time to help master the content. It is a quick spot check for me to see how to differentiate a lesson to help all students achieve.

What I notice as a result . . .

I have noticed that my students are taking more responsibility for their work in class and have an overall better understanding of what we are doing and where we are going with the content. I as the teacher find it easier to differentiate and monitor to help all students at their levels.

**WHEN ASSESSMENTS** *FOR* **AND** *OF* **LEARNING OVERLAP.** We can plan assessments *for* and *of* learning so formative assessment information is never used summatively and summative assessment information is never used formatively. Or, under certain circumstances, we can and should use for one purpose assessments originally intended for the other.

When we design separate assessments *for* and *of* learning, we can structure some assessments to fulfill one or more formative uses: practice, diagnosis, feedback, or self-assessment; and others to contribute to a summative judgment of level of achievement, such as a chapter or unit test, a midterm examination, or a culminating performance or project. In this case we designate some of the work students do as formative and identify which formative use each will fulfill (as described in the Assessment Planning Cycle in Chapter 4 ). We designate other assessments to function summatively, using the information they generate to document levels of individual student achievement for reporting purposes. Summative assessments may be planned so that each one covers a different set of learning targets, with the final grade calculated by combining information across assessments. Or periodic summative assessments may be planned so that later tests include learning targets from earlier assessments. If students demonstrate a higher level of mastery of earlier concepts, summative judgments of level of achievement can be updated. The advantage here is that the more current information can and should replace the outof-date information.

Sometimes complete separation of assessments *for* and *of* learning isn't necessary or practical. For example, in English language arts classes, where students engage in the writing process (prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and  publishing), students may prepare several drafts of a piece of writing. The earlier drafts are used formatively—teachers and/or other students provide feedback and students act on it to revise their writing. They may also self-assess their later drafts using a scoring rubric. With each revision, the goal is to practice and improve. At some point, students may turn a final draft as evidence of their level of achievement in writing, to be graded (the publishing stage of the writing process). In this instance, the same assignment has been used first formatively, perhaps several times as the work moves through multiple drafts, and then summatively when it becomes a final draft.
Or teachers (and sometimes students) might select from a collection of work those pieces that provide the best evidence to be used summatively to determine level of achievement. For example, in the primary grades, some school districts use developmental continua for assessing reading and writing learning targets. These continua track student achievement through a series of levels designed to span several grades. Each stage in each continuum is defined and illustrated with samples of student work. Teachers can select work at predetermined times during the school year to reflect each student's current level of achievement. This evidence can be used to report progress to parents and to summarize student standing for the district without requiring a separate summative assessment event.

Any learning target at any grade level where proficiency develops over time is a potential candidate for intentional movement from assessment *for* learning to assessment *of* learning. These include reasoning, skill, and product targets e.g., problem solving or communication in mathematics, creating research reports, displaying data, giving oral presentations, planning and carrying out experiments, or playing a musical instrument. Reasoning, skill, and product targets tend to be taught throughout content units; they generally require repeated opportunities to practice with feedback in order to develop over time. In some of these instances we assign tasks that are repeated as formative and then summative assessment events.

On the flip side, as we have seen in Chapters 5 through 8 , summative assessments can and should sometimes be used formatively. When students analyze the results of a summative test to see which targets they have mastered and which they haven't, and then are provided an opportunity to retest and receive credit for their higher level of achievement, we are using a test whose primary purpose is assessment *of* learning as an instance of assessment *for* learning, thereby *increasing what students have learned* . Or, when we plan a test as a summative event and notice from the results that many students had difficulty with one or more learning targets, we might decide to reteach and retest those targets. This is another instance of an assessment *of* learning being used as assessment *for* learning, again increasing what students have learned.

 Figure 9.3 shows a form you can use plan for both formative and summative assessment events throughout a unit or module of study.

### **DECIDING WHERE YOU WILL KEEP THE INFORMATION**

Historically, our tracking system has taken the form of a *gradebook* , whether we keep it in hard copy or electronically. That is a bit of a misnomer these days, because we need to record information beyond summative grades. When we broaden the uses of assessment information to include formative applications, we may also need to consider different record book options.

The first choice is the physical location(s) for your evidence—on paper or in a computer program. Will you write information by hand in a gradebook? Will you keep records by hand on a form you design yourself? Will you design a record- keeping system on your computer? Will you use a commercially developed electronic gradebook program? Will you use some combination of these options or something else?

To help you decide, remember that you will need to be able to differentiate formative and summative data. Hardcopy options include the following:

- Formative and summative data clearly labeled and recorded together
- Formative and summative data recorded separately

Figures 9.4 and 9.5 show examples of formative and summative data recorded together. In Figure 9.4 , each column is marked either "F" for "formative" or "S" for "summative." There is also a column marked "test" for data from a cumulative assessment following each mathematics strand. Some teachers prefer a less formal system for differentiating entries—they enter formative data in pencil and summative data in pen or devise some other color or marking code.

Figure 9.5 shows an English language arts example where students are assigned three writing tasks for the quarter, each of which goes through two revisions with feedback and one edit with feedback before being evaluated for a grade. Each writing assignment begins as a formative assessment and ends as a summative assessment. In this example, for the two criteria of *Ideas and Content* and *Organization* , the formative data for each assignment is labeled as "draft" and the summative data is labeled as "final." For the criterion of *Conventions* , the formative data is labeled as "edit" and the summative data is labeled as "final."

You can also keep the data in separate sections on the same page, on different pages of the record book, or in different books. Figure 9.6 shows an example of formative and summative data recorded separately on the same page, where all entries except those labeled "Test" are formative.

Electronic options may be limited by the program you are using but most will allow you to create separate categories weighted differently, which you can use as "bins" for formative and summative data, as shown in Figure 9.7 .

If you are keeping hardcopy records, you will also have the choice of how you organize each student's data. Some teachers, especially at the elementary level, like to have a separate page or section for each student, but for many teachers it makes most sense to have all students on the same page.

It is also possible to supplement records with collections of student work, which can provide more detailed assessment information to be used formatively or summatively. We describe ways to do this in Chapter 11 .

 In sorting through the options, although there is no one best choice, it is helpful to keep the rule *form follows function* in mind: how you want to use the information should drive your decision about how to organize it. For example, you may keep the summative information in an electronic gradebook because the final grade will be calculated from these electronic records, and record formative information by hand in a log because you want to be able to access it quickly and revise it while moving around the classroom.

### **RECORD-KEEPING GUIDELINES**

After you have made initial decisions about what will be formative and what will be summative, where you want to keep the information, and what information students will track, you are ready to set up the tracking system. We suggest three record- keeping guidelines that apply to both formative and summative information to indicate the learning targets represented by your data and to maximize the usefulness of your entries:

- **1.** Organize entries by learning target.
- **2.** Track information about work habits and social skills separately.
- **3.** Record achievement information by raw score, if practical.

#### **Guideline 1: Organize Entries by Learning Represented**

The first guideline governs the labels and categories in your recording system. When both instruction and assessments have focused on specific learning targets, it is an

easy transition to record the resulting information according to the learning target being assessed. And when your report card format is standards based, recording data by learning target makes it easy to merge your data into that template. Organizing a record book this way also can help you track student progress by learning target, diagnose and remediate difficulties, and speak knowledgeably about the state of student learning during conferences.

Traditionally, we have categorized summative assessment information by the type of evidence—homework, quiz, lab, test, homework, and so on—rather than by the learning represented. With a system in place to differentiate formative from summative data, categories for types of evidence become less useful while categories that indicate the learning represented become more useful.

To use the results of assessments to provide descriptive feedback, to plan instruction, and to track student progress toward important content standards, we must organize the information by learning target or by target clusters. How much detail to record is up to you. What do you want to do with the information? With formative records, we generally benefit from capturing more detail rather than less about specific learning targets, whereas with summative records we can combine separate learning target information into the content standards they contribute to, or even into strands representing several content standards when our purpose is to report out an overall level of achievement.

For example, Figure 9.8 shows a record for a third-grade mathematics class. It is organized so that the entries are grouped by the individual learning targets this teacher is focusing on during the grading period. Each set of learning targets is identified by content strand. This example illustrates what this looks like for two content strands, *Number Sense* and *Computation* . This teacher's report card requires that students receive a grade for each content strand, so he will be able to aggregate the summative data for each learning target to calculate the grade. He will also be able to review the formative data to determine who needs further instruction and on what, prior to administering the summative assessment.

Figure 9.4 also shows data organized by strand. In this example, the specific learning targets addressed during the grading period are numbered and the record book identifies the learning target by its number. In Figure 9.5 , the categories *Ideas and Content* , *Organization* , and *Conventions* represent learning target clusters. Each target cluster has an associated list of learning targets that also correspond to the rubric used to assess the learning targets. For example, *Ideas and Content* at the middle school level includes learning targets related to *focus* and *supporting details* . The rubric for *Ideas and Content* provides descriptive detail for each of these two learning targets at various levels of achievement, from high to low. So a rubric score could be used formatively because it is attached to a stable description representing each of these two learning targets. A teacher might want to separate those two learning targets and teach to them separately, in which case, she may want to revise this record book to allow for data entry on each of those two learning targets.

Figure 9.6 shows both content strands and individual learning targets. It uses shorthand for the learning targets. For example, *Syn/Ant* refers to the learning target "Identify synonyms and antonyms," *Pre/Suf* refers to the learning target "Identify the meanings of prefixes and suffixes," and *Fluency* refers to the learning target "Reads aloud with fluency." The content strands "Applies skills and strategies to read" and "Understands what is read" are two of the report card categories that this teacher will report on separately under the umbrella of "Reading."

Notice that in Figures 9.4 through 9.8 there is a place to keep track of the assignment, even though it is not the major organizer of information. In Figures 9.4 and 9.8 , assignment information goes into the column labeled "Task." This is where you can record the page number or other identifying details about the specific assignment. In Figure 9.6 , it is labeled "Assignment." In Figure 9.5 , the writing assignments are numbered 1, 2, and 3 to indicate the writing assignment. Instead of numbering the assignments, you could name them if you wanted to and had the space.

#### **Guideline 2: Track Information about Work Habits and Social Skills Separately**

To use the summative information to calculate a standards-based grade, we will need to track information about achievement level separately from information about work habits and social skills. Student characteristics such as class participation, compliance with rules, academic honesty, attitude, neatness, timeliness of work turned in, attendance, cooperation with classmates, and level of classroom attention all contribute to learning. So it's fine to identify the work habits and social skills you want to track and report. If the categories you identify are broad, such as "effort" or "work habits," you will need to define the actions that underlie them. What do we mean by *effort* ? Work turned in on time? Class participation? Neatness? Regular attendance? This work is best done as a team—department, grade level, school, or district—so that students experience consistency of stated expectations. And you will need to devise ways of assessing these things to provide dependable evidence for all students.

In that regard, all that we have said about the need for clear academic learning targets accurately assessed and reported applies to behavioral expectations as well as achievement. Remember that you must get an accurate and fair estimate for reporting purposes. This requires that you know what you are looking for, gather accurate evidence, track the same characteristics consistently over time, and that you transform (summarize) evidence appropriately for reporting. All students must know what characteristics contribute to that evaluation, as this helps them to be clear about the behaviors you expect, will be tracking, and will be reporting. Further, when there is a problem, the diagnosis can be specific, which helps in communicating the problem to students and parents and in devising a solution.

After you have defined these expectations, set up a system for tracking them that works for you, keeping in mind how you want to use the information. Keeping these valuable pieces of information separate facilitates instructional planning, diagnosing problems, communicating about them, and devising solutions to remedy them. If we don't record academic achievement separately from work habits and social skills, raising or lowering the grade stands as the only solution to a disparate range of learning problems. It is clear that the punishment and reward system grades have evolved into does not work to solve these problems for a whole host of students (see Stiggins & Chappuis, 2011).

**EXTRA CREDIT WORK.** Does extra credit work provide evidence of effort or achievement? Is it an avenue to a higher grade or a way to engage in and demonstrate further learning? When it is used as a means to raise a grade, often all that gets recorded is points for completion. When it is used as a way to engage in and demonstrate further learning, we evaluate the work and record the score in the same way that we evaluate and record any other evidence of achievement.

Simply awarding completion points for extra credit work has two problems. First, the points may not represent evidence of achievement—they tend to be "effort" points. Even though we might hope the extra credit work takes the student further, without an evaluation of the quality of what the student submits, we have no way of knowing. Second, introducing " effort" points into the record of academic achievement will artificially inflate the grade when it comes time to calculate one (O'Connor, 2011), and it will no longer accurately represent level of achievement.

*"Grades are broken when they do not accurately communicate achievement. The fix for this is to make grades as pure a measure as possible of student achievement: that is, make them reflect* only *student performance in mastering the public, published learning goals . . ." (O'Connor, 2011, p. 16 )*

So do not use extra credit work to add "effort" points to the grade. Think of extra credit work as an opportunity for students to engage in and demonstrate further learning. Base any points awarded on the quality of the work as it relates to the learning targets students are in the process of mastering. When the work has caused an increase in learning, the points can function accurately as further evidence of achievement.

This assumes that the extra credit work relates directly to the learning targets students are working on. If it doesn't, as is the case when students earn extra credit for bringing in boxes of tissue, then there is no defensible basis for awarding points toward a grade for the "work."

**MISSING OR LATE WORK AND CHEATING.** What about the issues of poor work habits or academic dishonesty? How should that evidence be recorded? It is tempting to record a lowered grade or a zero when student work is accompanied with problems such as these. However, we advise for several reasons that you look for another way to track, correct, and/or punish such problems. First, lowered scores and zeroes are not accurate representations of the student's current level of achievement. Regardless of the other problems the student has, we should not take their evidence of learning away from them, either as a preventative measure or as a punishment. Second, it does not work to change the behavior of students who have made themselves indifferent to lowered grades. They are more willing to risk the consequences than to do the work, for a variety of reasons. Yet these are the very students who, if they would just do the work and learn from it, would be succeeding at higher levels because they would be learning more and not just because they would have more points. Third, lowering scores and assigning zeroes keeps us

*No grade ever recovers fully from the effect of a zero, for whatever reason it is assigned.* 

from addressing the underlying problems. Especially at the secondary level, it can be difficult to take the time with any one student to understand why the work is not coming in or why they felt pressured to cheat. Yet, these students are developing behaviors that will not serve them well as adults and if we can identify the students and their problems while they are with

us, we have a responsibility to retrain them within the system in more productive approaches to learning.

If we wish to provide solutions or consequences for unproductive behavior, those actions or punishments must take a form that does not distort the student's actual record of academic achievement. That record is too important for informing subsequent instructional decisions in a standards-driven environment to permit its distortion. We encourage you to work with your colleagues and your school to identify other solutions to and consequences for the problems for which lowered grades and zeroes have been the consequence in the past.

For example, a team of teachers from Orange Middle School in Lewis Center, Ohio, has created a "grade-free" way of dealing with late work—students fill out a sheet, shown in Example 9.2 , and attach it to any late work. Non–grade-related solutions and consequences progress with the number of instances of late work. As team member Jessica Cynkar explains: "My team prints the sheets on brightly colored paper and we make students fill them out to submit late work. Students don't like filling the sheets out because it is a lot of work. I also have a record to talk to parents about (kids are typically pretty honest in their responses) when I have a concern or at conferences" (personal communication).

They report a significant decrease in missing or late work as a result.

#### **Guideline 3: Record Achievement Information by Raw Score, if Practical**

In Chapter 10 , we will look at the procedure for converting achievement data into a summary grade. Until then, we retain the most options for accurate use of information if we keep raw scores—the number of points awarded in relation to the number possible; e.g., 4/5 or 32/38. Raw scores give instant access to the sample size. When we only record a percent or a summative mark, the detail is lost. For example, if a student gets 2 out of 3 points correct on an assignment, you could record it as 2/3, as 67 percent, or as a D. On a different task the student could get a score of 12 out of 18, which you could record as 12/18, as 67 percent, or as a D. If each of these tasks covers the same learning target, which provides the more stable estimate of student achievement? Having access to raw scores will also help with weighting decisions when combining information to calculate a final grade.

If we are recording rubric scores for summative use, it is essential to use the raw score. Accurately calculating a final grade from a mixture of rubric scores and other data requires that we record the rubric score in its original form. In Chapter 10 , we will also look at how to convert rubric scores to grades once they are recorded.

When the intended use is formative, whether the information is number correct out of number possible, number of points earned out of number possible, a rubric score, or some other mark, a raw score gives more detail. This helps in planning instruction and in keeping track of progress on each achievement target.

Sometimes it is useful to have access to more than just a number—we may want to keep samples of student work in a working folder or portfolio. We discuss folder and portfolio options in Chapter 11 . In the case of evidence gathered through personal communication, you may have created anecdotal records keyed to learning targets or standards of quality represented on a rubric, which you may also keep in a file on your computer or in a folder or notebook.

### **OPTIONS FOR STUDENT RECORD KEEPING**

The benefits of student-involved record keeping far outweigh the initial effort it takes to get a system going. First, tracking their progress toward a learning target and identifying when they have mastered it helps students understand the impact of effort. Second, when students experience positive growth, the process of tracking itself can be motivating. Third, having a record of achievement at hand helps students engage in self-reflection activities and discuss their progress meaningfully with others.

These are prerequisites to student-involved record keeping:

- Assignments and assessments align directly with the intended learning target(s).
- Students know which learning target is represented by each piece of assignment or assessment information.
- The learning targets are clear to students.

 Student tracking systems can take a number of forms. For example, students can record progress by assignment, as shown in Figure 9.9 . In this example, the students write the following:

- Information to identify the assignment (e.g., page number, title, project name)
- Date of assignment
- Learning target or learning target number (referenced to a list)
- The score received (e.g., points earned/points possible)
- Whether the assignment was formative (for practice) or summative (for a mark or grade)
- Their strengths related to the learning target and areas for improvement or next steps related to the learning target

In the "stars and stairs" column, students are copying or paraphrasing the feedback the teacher has offered or they are interpreting the evaluative information on the assignment to self-assess and set a target for further learning.

Or students can graph their results on both practice activities and tests. Figure 9.10 shows an example of a tracking form where students graph results on reading targets with both right/wrong data and rubric score data. Two of the learning targets, "Identifies synonyms and antonyms" and "Understands the meaning of prefixes and suffixes," are knowledge targets practiced and assessed with selected response questions. The third target, "Reads aloud with fluency," is a skill target practiced and assessed with a five-point rubric. In this example, students have three practice events for each learning target. The first two learning targets have 10 problems and the third learning target is awarded a maximum of 5 points, corresponding to the rubric score points. After each practice assignment, students graph their results by learning target. When they take the test, they also graph their results by learning target. This record enables students to notice where they are improving and where they are having difficulty. Rather than conclude she is not good at reading, a student is able to say, "I am good at synonyms and antonyms and at prefixes and suffixes, but I need to work on fluency."

Another tracking option is to have students record their scores as well as notes about strengths and areas needing work by learning target, as shown in Figure 9.11 . This example is set up to be used with selected response or written response information. As with the other examples, information is organized by learning target, but with this form you may have a separate page or half-sheet for each learning target, especially if students are also collecting samples of their work for use in a portfolio. That way, they can collect their work samples by learning target and their records of achievement can also be grouped by learning target.

 This last example, shown in Figure 9.12 , is a variation from an activity described in Chapter 5 , where students analyze their quiz or test results, identifying which problems they got right, which they got wrong due to a simple mistake, and which

they got wrong because they don't yet understand it. Students then translate that information into a generalization about which learning targets they have mastered, which learning targets they need to keep focusing on, and which they need to fine tune. A record sheet such as this one can help them self-assess and set goals for continued learning and can become a part of a portfolio shared during a conference as well.

**FIGURE 9.12** Students Tracking Quiz or Test Results


 **My Classroom Then and Now 9.2 Elizabeth Schroeder**
I used to . . .

First, I used to grade every piece of work that my students completed. I was of the mindset that work is not valued unless it is acknowledged . . . and I thought that acknowledgement was a letter grade. Second, I used to use what I call a "tracking sheet" that students could use to follow their progress on learning targets, formatives, and summative—an organizer to remind them of the goals, take part in their own learning, and give them a way to evaluate their own work and progress (see For Example 9.1 ). However, it was "hit or miss" with the tracking sheet and it was hard to keep it up to date and was eventually placed in their binder unfinished. Lastly, I used to let everyone take the summative test at the end of the unit, regardless of their completion or understanding of their practice work. This procedure resulted in many incomplete assignments and lower scores on the summative exam.

Now I . . .

I still acknowledge every piece of work that my students complete. However, I have developed a new way to look at standards, learning, and grading. I began educating students, parents, and ME that everything does not need to be given a letter grade. I now show formative work as "collected" in the grade book. I still check their assignments to make sure that they understand the learning goal before moving on; but I check student work with them, individually, giving them direct feedback—as they do the work and while it is fresh in their mind instead of by me on my sofa at home. The value is now my time instead of a grade.

The next thing I changed was the unit tracking sheet. I kept the main portions of the document to gauge their learning, tweaking a few words here and there; but the major change came in the use of the page. The students now refer to it every day, bringing it with them as we check their practice work. I make initials on the work they complete and then at the end of the summative exam they evaluate their progress, charting their course of work.

The last thing I changed was the requirements to take the summative exam. Previously, I would allow students to take the test if some of their formative work was not turned in. I had a certain day that it was scheduled and everybody took it. Now, I have a "test day", but only the students who have successfully completed the formative work are allowed to take it. If a student does not get to take the test that day, it is their responsibility to finish their practice work and then take the test on their own time.

Why I changed . . .

I knew the pieces were not working right. I learned a new way of making it happen as I envisioned it through reading the book *Classroom Assessment* for *Student Learning*.

What I notice as a result . . .

WOW! So many things to report as change! My students are more engaged in their learning. They enjoy showing me their work instead of placing it in a box for a grade. They put more effort in their practice, knowing that I will be reviewing it with them, and they enjoy the one-on-one attention. Secondly, I now have a tracking sheet that is used as a personal assessment piece, a quick look for a parent/conference meeting, and a gauge for standards-based learning. Lastly, my students WANT to complete their practice—because lack of effort or incomplete means NO GRADE in my class. And the biggest change has been the numbers of "incomplete work" to report. **It is now nonexistent .**

### **Summary**

Both assessments *for* and *of* learning play a crucial role in determining and communicating levels of student learning. We can develop a variety of protocols to maintain accurate records that allow us to use each source of information in the ways we intend.

We begin with preliminary decisions regarding which information will be used formatively and which will be used summatively, keeping in mind that sometimes the uses overlap. We decide what formative assessment information it makes sense to record. And we think about what formative assessment information students might keep track of.

Next we move to options for the physical location and layout of the information. This is where we keep in mind that *form follows function* : our choices should be guided by the intended use of the data. Options include hardcopy and electronic gradebooks, formative and summative data kept in the same or different places, students' information kept together or separate, and methods for differentiating formative from summative data.

We explain three guidelines for record keeping so that the data can always be traced back to the learning it represents and so that you can maximize the usefulness of your entries. The first is to organize the entries by the learning represented. The second is to keep track of information about work habits and social skills separate from academic achievement information. This also has implications for what we do with extra credit work, with missing or late work, and with work displaying evidence of academic dishonesty. The third guideline is to record achievement information by raw score when practical, rather than by percent or symbol, to retain the most options for accurate use of the data.

Last, we offer suggestions for how students might track their achievement with both formative and summative assessment information, helping them stay in touch with their own progress as learners.

With a protocol in place, tracking assessments *for* and *of* learning in the

classroom does not need to consume a lot of time. If our classroom assessments are of high quality, we will be able to calculate a justifiable grade with fewer assessment scores than may be in place in many gradebooks now.

- **3.** List the learning targets that will be the focus of instruction during the unit in the order you will teach them.
- **4.** Describe the assignments and assessments that will serve a summative purpose for each learning target. Descriptions can take the form of page numbers, assignment or assessment titles or numbers, or any other information that works for you. Note the approximate date for each and mark it with the letter "S" for "Summative" in the column labeled "Type."
- **5.** Describe any pretests, checks for understanding, or quizzes you plan to administer to guide further instruction. Descriptions can take the form of page numbers, assignment or assessment titles or numbers, or any other information that works for you. Note the approximate date for each and mark it with the letter "C" for "Check for learning" in the column labeled "Type."
- **6.** Describe the practice event or events that students will engage in for each learning target. Descriptions can take the form of page numbers, assignment titles, or any other information that works for you. Note the approximate date for each and mark it with the letter "P" for "Practice" in the column labeled "Type."
- **7.** Describe any other formative assessment events that students will engage in, along with the approximate date.
- **8.** Follow the plan. Note any adjustments needed. Revise the plan for future use.
- **9.** Share your plan with a partner or your team. Described what worked well and what you will revise.

Formative and Summative Assessment Plan

##### **Activity 9.3 Organize Your Recording System**

After reading the section titled "Deciding Where You Will Keep the Information," work independently, with a partner, or with a team to make the following decisions.

- **1.** Physical location—where will you keep the summative information? Where will you keep the formative information?
- **2.** If you keep them in the same place, how will you differentiate formative from summative information? Review Figures 9.4 through 9.7 for ideas. Select an option, modify an option, or create your own.
- **3.** What information does it make sense for students also to track?

After reading the section titled "Guideline 1: Organize Entries by Learning Represented," work independently, with a partner, or with your team to make the following decisions. You may also want to review Figures 9.4 through 9.8 for ideas.

- **1.** How will you identify the learning represented by each formative entry? How much detail will you want in the heading of each column? What kinds of headings will you use?
- **2.** How will you identify the learning represented by each summative entry? How much detail will you want in the heading of each column? What kinds of headings will you use?
- **3.** After making these decisions, revise your recording system and try it out for a few weeks.
- **4.** Share with a partner or your team the structure of your recording system, the adjustments you have made, and what you may need yet to refine.
